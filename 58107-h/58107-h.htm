<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The new-old art of story telling is being
rediscovered. We are finding that the
children&#8217;s daily story hour in school, in the
neighborhood house, and at home is a real
force for mental and moral good in their lives.
We are learning that it is possible to educate
children by means of stories.</p>

<p>Story telling to be a developing factor in a
child&#8217;s life must be studied by the story teller.
There are good stories and there are poor
stories for children. The story that fits a
child&#8217;s needs to-day may not prove a wise
choice for him to-morrow. Some stories
teach, some stories only give joy, some stories
inspire, some stories just make a child laugh.
Each of these story phases is important. To
discover these special types of stories, to fit
stories to the individual child or child group,
and to make over stories for perfect telling
has been my aim in writing this book.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>Through telling stories to many thousands
of children and lecturing to students I have
found that story telling is a matter of psychology.
The pages that follow give my new theory
of story telling to the teacher or parent.</p>

<small>THE APPERCEPTIVE BASIS OF STORY TELLING</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">APPERCEPTION is a formidable and
sometimes confusing term for a very
simple and easy-to-understand mental process.
I once told Seumus MacManus&#8217; deliciously
humorous story of Billy Beg and his Bull to a
group of foreign boys and girls in one of New
York&#8217;s East Side Settlement Houses. The
children listened with apparent appreciation,
but, halfway along in the story, it occurred to
me to ask them if they had ever seen a bull.
No one answered me at first. Then Pietro, a
little dusky-eyed son of Italy, raised a grimy
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seen one last summer when we was on a
<i>fresh-air</i>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bigger cow, a bull
is, with the bicycle handle-bars on her head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pietro&#8217;s description of a bull was an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of apperception, the method by means of
which a new idea is interpreted, classified,
&#8220;let into&#8221; the human mind. He knew the
class, <i>cows</i>. He also knew the class, <i>bicycles</i>.
He did not know the class, <i>bulls</i>&mdash;at least vividly
enough to be able to put the idea into
terms of a verbal explanation and description.
So he did the most natural thing in the world,
the only possible mental process in fact by
means of which children or adults classify the
<i>new</i>. He interpreted it in terms of the old,
explaining the unfamiliar idea, bull, by means
of the familiar ideas, cow and a bicycle.</p>

<p>This, then, is apperception. <i>It is the involuntary
mental process by means of which
the human mind makes its own the strange,
the new, the unfamiliar idea by a method of
fitting it into the class of familiar ideas already
known.</i> Apperception is a means of
quick mental interpretation. It is the welcoming
of strangers to the mind-habitation,
strangers who come every day in the guise of
unfamiliar names, terms, scenes, and phrases,
and determining in which corner of the brain
house they will fit most comfortably. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
most natural process is finally to give these
new ideas an old mind corner to rest in, or an
old brain path in which to travel.</p>

<p>A child&#8217;s mind at the age when he is able
to concentrate upon listening to a story, three
or four years of age&mdash;kindergarten age&mdash;is
not a very crowded house. It is a mind-house
tenanted by a few and very simple concepts
which he has made his own through his previous
home, mother and play experiences. He
is familiar with his nursery, his pets, his
family, his toys, his food, his bed. If he is a
country child he knows certain flowers, birds
and farm animals, not as classes&mdash;flower, bird
and animal&mdash;but as <i>buttercup</i>, <i>robin</i> and <i>sheep</i>.
If he is a city child his mind has a very different
tenantry, and he thinks in terms of <i>street</i>,
<i>subway</i>, <i>park</i>, <i>fire engine</i>, <i>ambulance</i>. These
to the city child are also individual ideas, not
classes. He knows them as compelling, noisy,
moving ideas which he has seen and experienced,
but they do not at all appeal to him as
classes.</p>

<p>The story of &#8220;The Three Bears&#8221; is an obviously
interesting one to children upon entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
school. It has its basis of interest in its
apperceptive quality, and it illustrates better
than almost any other story for children those
qualities which bring about quick mental interpretation
on the part of the listener. The
unusual, strange, hazardous characters in
the story, the three bears, are introduced to
the child in old, comfortably familiar terms
which catch his interest from the first sentence
of the story. It is extremely doubtful if the
story of three bears set in a polar or forest environment
would ever have been popular so
long or made so many children happy as has
the story of the historical three bears who
lived in a house, ate porridge from bowls, sat
in chairs and slept in beds. Nor are these the
only apperceptive links between the life of the
bears and that of the child. There is a tiny
bear in the story, the size, one may presuppose,
of the child who is listening to the story. The
to-be-classified idea, <i>bear</i>, is presented to children
in this old folk tale in terms of already
known ideas, <i>house</i>, <i>porridge</i>, <i>chair</i>, <i>bed</i> and
<i>tiny</i>. Very few story tellers have appreciated
the underlying psychologic appeal of the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of &#8220;The Three Bears,&#8221; but it illustrates a quality
in stories that we must look for if we wish
to make the story we select a permanency in
the child&#8217;s mental life.</p>

<p><i>The apperceptive basis of story telling consists
in study on the part of the story teller to
discover what is the store of ideas in the minds
of the children who will listen to the story.</i></p>

<p>Has the story too many new ideas for the
child to be able to classify them in terms of
his old ideas? On the other hand, has it one
or two new thoughts so carefully presented
through association with already familiar concepts
that the child will be able to make them
his own and give them a permanent place in
his mind with the old ones?</p>

<p>A child&#8217;s mind is an eery place for an adult
to try and enter. Teachers, kindergartners
and story tellers are a little prone to think
that a knowledge of one child&#8217;s mental content
gives them the power to know the mind
of the child-at-large. Our psychologists have
given us studies of child mind, not child
minds. This mind hypothesis is, perhaps, sufficient
for the general working out of systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of teaching, but success in the delicate art of
story telling means a most critical study and
observation of the minds of the special group
of children who will hear the story. The
story teller must ask herself these questions:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do these children <i>know</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they any experience other than that
of the home on which to bank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do they come from homes of leisure or
homes of industry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they had a country or a city experience?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they passed from the stage of development
when toys formed their play interest
to the game stage in which chance and hazard
interest them more deeply?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they American children, familiar with
American institutions, or are they little aliens
in our land, unfamiliar with and confused by
our ways?&#8221;</p>

<p>When she has satisfactorily answered these
questions, the story teller will select her story
having for its theme, atmosphere and <i>motif</i>
an idea or group of ideas that will touch the
child&#8217;s mental life as she has discovered it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
by means of which it will find a permanent
place in his mind through its comfortable
friendliness and familiarity.</p>

<p>The child who has come directly from his
home and the sheltering arms of his mother
or nurse should not, at first, be taken far afield
through the lands of fairies and giants. If he
is told a fairy story, it should have for its content
the sweet, homely qualities that characterize
the home. I am using as a good example
of the apperceptive story, &#8220;The Cap that
Mother Made.&#8221; The child listeners are carried,
it is true, to the palace of a King and are
formally introduced to a Princess, but this is
brought about through the familiar symbols
of the home: <i>mother</i>, <i>brothers</i>, the <i>farmer</i>, and
the queer little <i>cap</i> with its red and green
stripes and blue tassel. Although Anders,
the story hero, spends a happy hour at the
Princess&#8217; ball, he finally finds his way home
again, and the story has an apperceptive appeal
which is unusual. It is full of precious,
familiar concepts that establish an association
in the child&#8217;s mind between fairyland and
home. After hearing the story, he will be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
apt always to remember a palace as a very
charming place to visit, but not to stay in, when
one may go home to mother.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cap that Mother Made</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy named
Anders, who had a new cap. And a prettier cap
you never have seen, for mother herself had knit
it; and nobody could make anything quite so nice
as mother did. It was altogether red, except a
small part in the middle which was green, for the
red yarn had given out; and the tassel was blue.</p>

<p>His brothers and sisters walked about squinting
at him, and their faces grew long with envy. But
Anders cared nothing about that. He put his
hands in his pockets and went out for a walk, for
he wished everybody to see how fine he looked in
his new cap.</p>

<p>The first person he met was a farmer walking
along by the side of a wagon load of wood. He
made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking.
He was dumbfounded, I can tell you, when
he saw it was nobody but Anders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if I did not think it was
the gracious little count himself!&#8221; And then he
invited Anders to ride in his wagon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>But when one has a pretty, red cap with a blue
tassel, one is too fine to ride in a wagon, and Anders
walked proudly by.</p>

<p>At the turn of the road he met the tanner&#8217;s son,
Lars. He was such a big boy that he wore high
boots, and carried a jack-knife. He gaped and
gazed at the cap, and could not keep from fingering
the blue tassel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s trade caps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will give you
my jack-knife to boot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this knife was a very good one, though
half the blade was gone and the handle was a little
cracked; and Anders knew that one is almost a
man as soon as one has a jack-knife. But still
it did not come up to the new cap which mother
had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I&#8217;m not so stupid as all that; no, I&#8217;m
not!&#8221; Anders said.</p>

<p>And then he said good-by to Lars with a nod;
but Lars only made faces at him, for he had not
been to school much, poor boy; and, besides, he
was very much put out because he could not
cheat Anders out of his cap which mother had
made.</p>

<p>Anders went along, and he met a very old, old
woman who courtesied till her skirts looked like a
balloon. She called him a little gentleman, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
said that he was fine enough to go to the royal
court ball.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, why not?&#8221; thought Anders. &#8220;Seeing
that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the
King.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so he did. In the palace yard stood two
soldiers with shining helmets, and with muskets
over their shoulders; and when Anders came to
the gate, both the muskets were leveled at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where may you be going?&#8221; asked one of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to the court ball,&#8221; answered Anders.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are not,&#8221; said the other soldier, stepping
forward. &#8220;Nobody is allowed there without
a uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>But just at this instant the princess came tripping
across the yard. She was dressed in white
silk with bows of gold ribbon. When she saw
Anders and the soldiers, she walked over to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he has such a very fine cap
on his head, and that will do just as well as a uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she took Anders&#8217; hand and walked with
him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers
were posted at every third step, and through the
beautiful halls where courtiers in silk and velvet
stood bowing wherever he went. For no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
they thought him a prince when they saw his fine
cap.</p>

<p>At the farther end of the largest hall a table
was set with golden cups and golden plates in long
rows. On huge silver dishes were piles of tarts
and cakes, and red wine sparkled in shining
glasses.</p>

<p>The princess sat down at the head of this long
table; and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by
her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must not eat with your cap on your
head,&#8221; she said, putting out her hand to take it
off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I can eat just as well,&#8221; said Anders,
holding on to his cap; for if they should take it
away from him nobody would any longer believe
that he was a prince; and, besides, he did not feel
sure that he would get it back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, give it to me,&#8221; said the princess,
&#8220;and I will give you a kiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>The princess was certainly beautiful, and Anders
would have dearly liked to be kissed by her,
but the cap which mother had made he would not
give up on any condition. He only shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but see,&#8221; said the princess; and she filled
his pockets with cakes, and put her own gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
chain around his neck, and bent down and kissed
him.</p>

<p>But he only moved farther back in his chair
and did not take his hands away from his head.</p>

<p>Then the doors were thrown open, and the
King entered with a large number of gentlemen in
glittering uniforms and plumed hats. The King
himself wore a purple mantle which trailed behind
him, and he had a large gold crown on his
white curly hair.</p>

<p>He smiled when he saw Anders in the gilt
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a very fine cap you have,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; replied Anders. &#8220;Mother knit it of
her very best yarn, and everybody wishes to get
it away from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you would like to change caps with
me,&#8221; said the King, raising his large, heavy crown
from his head.</p>

<p>Anders did not answer. He sat as before, and
held on to his red cap which everybody was so
eager to get. But when the King came nearer to
him, with his gold crown between his hands, then
Anders grew frightened as never before. If he
did not take good care, the King might cheat him
out of his cap; for a King can do whatever he
likes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>With one jump Anders was out of his chair.
He darted like an arrow through all the beautiful
halls, down all the marble stairs, and across the
yard.</p>

<p>He twisted himself like an eel between the
outstretched arms of the courtiers, and over the
soldiers&#8217; muskets he jumped like a little rabbit.</p>

<p>He ran so fast that the princess&#8217;s necklace fell
off his neck, and all the cakes jumped out of his
pockets. But his cap he still had. He was holding
on to it with both hands as he rushed into his
mother&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p>His mother took him up in her lap, and he told
her all his adventures, and how everybody wanted
his cap. And all his brothers and sisters stood
around and listened with their mouths open.</p>

<p>But when his big brother heard that he had refused
to give his cap for the King&#8217;s golden crown,
he said that Anders was stupid. Just think how
much money one might get for the King&#8217;s crown;
and Anders could have had a still finer cap.</p>

<p>That Anders had not thought of, and his face
grew red. He put his arms around his mother&#8217;s
neck and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, was I stupid?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother hugged him close and kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my little son,&#8221; said she. &#8220;If you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
dressed in silver and gold from top to toe, you
could not look any nicer than in your little red
cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Anders felt brave again. He knew well
enough that mother&#8217;s cap was the best cap in all
the world.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This story is only an example of many
others that may be selected and fitted to the
mental status of the individual child or group
of children who make up the story circle. I
had great difficulty one season in gaining and
holding the attention of a group of particularly
rough boys to whom I was telling stories
in a neighborhood house. To my surprise,
they listened most attentively to an adaptation
of &#8220;The King of the Golden River,&#8221; and clamored
to have it repeated. Looking into the
reason for their keen interest in the story,
which really took them quite far afield in its
descriptions and plot, I discovered that the
incident of the holy water had gripped my
audience. The boys were Romanists and they
found a point in the story which touched their
own lives, in the visits of the brothers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Gluck to the priest. I never afterward found
difficulty in holding the attention of this special
group of boys. I had been able to establish
a bond of sympathy between the boys and
the story characters.</p>

<p>Touching a child&#8217;s life through the medium
of a story is like a friendly hand clasp. An
Irish folk tale told to a group of little sons and
daughters of Erin, one of the Uncle Remus
tales told to a kindergarten circle of little negroes,
the story of one of our Italian operas
adapted to the understanding of Sicilian and
Neapolitan children, one and all mean enriching
those child lives. How could the Gaelic
tale fit the Italian group, though, or the story
of the opera make an appeal to the little negro
boys and girls?</p>

<p>Successful story telling means, then, a careful
consideration of the apperceptive basis
of the story, first of all. This, reduced to very
simple terms, means studying the mental life
of a child and selecting for his first stories
those that have a well-defined association
through their word pictures, dialogue and
plot with the child&#8217;s own previous experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
When the story teller makes the question of
apperception the first consideration in selecting
her stories, she will find that her appeal
to the children will be an active and successful
one.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Goody Two Shoes</span></h3>

<p class="center"><small>SELECTED FOR ITS APPERCEPTIVE APPEAL</small></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course Goody Two Shoes was not her real
name. In fact, her father&#8217;s name was Meanwell,
and he had once been rich, and prosperous, and
one of the most well-to-do farmers in the parish,
but he lost his money. However it happened one
could hardly tell, but his farm was seized, and he
was turned out with his wife, and Tommy, and
little Marjery, with none of the necessaries of life
to support them.</p>

<p>Care and discontent shortened the days of
Farmer Meanwell. He was forced from his
family and taken with a violent fever of which
he died. Marjery&#8217;s poor mother died soon, too,
of a broken heart, and Marjery and her little
brother were left alone in the wide world; so they
started off together, hand in hand, to seek their
fortunes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>They were both very ragged, and though
Tommy had two shoes, Marjery had but one.
They neither had anything to support them save
what they picked from the hedges, or got from the
poor people; and they slept every night in a barn.
Their relations, who were rich folk, took no notice
of them, because they were ashamed to own
such a poor little ragged girl as Marjery and such
a dirty little curly-pated boy as Tommy.</p>

<p>But there was a very worthy clergyman named
Mr. Smith who lived in the parish where little
Marjery and Tommy were born; and having a
relation come to see him who was a charitable
man, he sent for these children. The gentleman
ordered little Marjery a new pair of shoes, gave
Mr. Smith some money to buy them clothes, and
said he would take Tommy and make of him a
little sailor. He had a new jacket and trousers
made for Tommy, and he was soon ready to start
for London.</p>

<p>It was hard indeed for Tommy and Marjery
to part. Tommy cried, and Marjery cried, and
they kissed each other a hundred times. At last
Tommy wiped off Marjery&#8217;s tears with the end of
his jacket and bid her cry no more, for he would
come to her again when he returned from sea,
and he began his journey with the kind gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
while Marjery went crying to bed. And the instant
that Marjery awoke the next morning, the
shoemaker came in with the new shoes for which
she had been measured.</p>

<p>Nothing could have helped little Marjery bear
the loss of Tommy more than the pleasure she
took in her two shoes. You remember she had
worn only one shoe before, and a ragged one at
that. She ran out to Mrs. Smith as soon as they
were put on, and stroking down her ragged apron
cried out, &#8220;Two shoes, Madam, see, two shoes!&#8221;
And so she behaved to all the people she met,
and she obtained the name of Goody Two
Shoes.</p>

<p>With Tommy gone there was not a great deal
for Goody Two Shoes to do, so she made up her
mind that she would learn to read. Now in the
long ago days when this little girl lived, one had
to pay quite a sum of money to go to a dame&#8217;s
school and be taught how to cross stitch, and to
bow politely, and to read. Only rich children
could go, but Goody Two Shoes would meet the
little boys and girls as they came from school, and
learn from them and then sit down and read
until they returned. After a while she had taught
herself more than they had learned of the dame,
and she resolved to go the rounds of all the farms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and teach the little children who were too poor to
go to school.</p>

<p>And such a clever, pleasant way of teaching
children to read as Goody Two Shoes invented!
With her knife she cut some wooden sets of letters
with which the children were to spell and
make sentences by laying them together. These
wooden letters she put in a basket and with the
basket over her arm she became a little trotting
tutoress who was known through all the countryside
for her kindness and patience.</p>

<p>Each morning she would start out at seven
and run up to the door of a farmhouse.</p>

<p>Tap, tap, tap!</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; the mother of the house would
ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only little Goody Two Shoes,&#8221; Marjery
would answer, &#8220;come to teach Billy his A B C&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Goody,&#8221; the mother would cry, opening
the door wide. &#8220;I am glad to see you. Billy
wants you sadly, for he has learned all his lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Billy would come out and have a new
spelling lesson set him with the basket of letters,
and then Goody would go on to Farmer Simpson&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bow, wow, wow!&#8221; said the dog at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sirrah,&#8221; Mistress Simpson would say, &#8220;why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
do you bark at Little Two Shoes? Come in.
Here&#8217;s Sally wants you sadly, for she has learned
all her lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then out came the little one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Goody,&#8221; she would say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Sally,&#8221; Goody Two Shoes
would answer; &#8220;have you learned your lesson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s what I have,&#8221; the little one would
say, as she took the letters and spelled <i>pear</i>, and
<i>plum</i>, and <i>top</i>, and <i>ball</i>, and <i>puss</i>, and <i>cow</i>, and
<i>lamb</i>, and <i>sheep</i>, and <i>bull</i>, and <i>cock</i>, and <i>hen</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Marjery, and she hurried on to
Gaffer Cook&#8217;s cottage. Here a number of poor
children were met to learn to read and they all
crowded around Marjery at once. So she pulled
out her letters and asked the little boy next to her
what he had for dinner. He answered, <i>bread</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;set the first letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he pulled out a big B, and soon the other
letters, and there stood the word as plain as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what had you, Polly Comb, for your dinner?&#8221;
asked Goody Two Shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apple-pie,&#8221; answered Polly as she spelled her
word.</p>

<p>The next child had potatoes, the next beef and
turnips, which were spelled with many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
words until the lesson was done, and Goody set
them a new task, and went on.</p>

<p>The next place she came to was Farmer
Thompson&#8217;s, where there were a great many little
ones waiting for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Miss Goody Two Shoes,&#8221; said one
of them, &#8220;where have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been teaching,&#8221; said Goody, &#8220;longer
than I intended, and am afraid I am come too soon
for you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but indeed you are not,&#8221; replied the
other, &#8220;for I have got my lesson, and so has Sally
Dawson, and so have we all,&#8221; and they capered
about as if they were overjoyed to see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you are all very good;
so let us begin our lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was indeed a wise and painstaking little
tutoress for a long, long time. At last Dame
Williams, who kept the village school for little
gentlemen and ladies, became very old and infirm,
and wanted to give up teaching. So the
trustees sent for Little Two Shoes to examine her
and see if she were able to keep the school.</p>

<p>They found that little Marjery was the best
scholar and had the best heart of any one who
wanted to be the teacher, and they gave her a
most favorable report.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>So Goody Two Shoes&#8217; troubles and travels were
over. She taught the dame school for the rest
of her days, and never lacked for shoes or anything
else needful.</p>

<small>THE STORY WITH A SENSE APPEAL</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE senses are the only avenues to the
brain by means of which the outside
world makes its way into a little child&#8217;s inner
consciousness. A baby&#8217;s brain is an almost
unexplored, untracked place, empty save for a
few instinct paths&mdash;certain motor tracts tenanted
by inherited memories which lead him
to cry, to nurse, and to perform some other
reflex movements. This condition of the mind
does not last long, however. The baby opens
his eyes and sees the sunlight dancing in a yellow
patch of gold upon the wall above his bed.
Instantly, like a telegraphic message, there is
delivered at the baby&#8217;s brain an idea, unnamed
at first but ineffaceable&mdash;<i>color</i>. When he sees
a red ball suspended by a string in front of his
eager eyes, a second message is delivered at
his mind-house, differentiating and localizing
the first impression&mdash;<i>color</i> versus <i>color</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The formal names, <i>red</i> and <i>yellow</i>, do not enter
into the process at all and are indeed quite
unnecessary. The baby differentiates <i>red</i> and
<i>yellow</i> months before he knows the color
names.</p>

<p>The baby hears his mother&#8217;s voice and he
receives by means of another telegraphic message
the percept, <i>sound</i>. He touches a piece
of ice, or his warm bottle, and learns by means
of this direct contact, <i>cold</i> and <i>warm</i>. His
nostrils admit the pleasurable odors of his
scented bath, the dainty powder used for making
his body comfortable or the bunch of roses
that stands on his mother&#8217;s table, and he receives
a new set of brain stimuli as he differentiates
odors.</p>

<p>These are all such simple mental operations
that we have rather taken them for granted,
forgetting that Nature&#8217;s method of forcing,
letting in impressions to the child&#8217;s mind, is the
only way for us to give him knowledge. <i>The
surest way of educating a child is through an
appeal to his senses.</i> In a large degree this
matter of sense training has been exemplified
in hand work by the disciples of Froebel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Montessori, but the <i>sense story</i> has been completely
overlooked. <i>We have made little effort
to appeal to a child&#8217;s mind through the
story that has sense images of sight, touch,
sound or taste to strengthen the mind impression
which it makes.</i></p>

<p>If we analyze the story that has interested us
most in a current magazine, we shall discover
that, somehow, it made a direct appeal to our
senses. It may have had the setting of some
old garden, the description of which made us,
in imagination, smell the clove pinks, roses,
French lilacs and mignonette that grew in
some garden of our childhood. Perhaps it
was a <i>sound</i> story, giving us such speaking
word pictures of bird songs, violin tones or
even the human notes of voices that we almost
<i>heard</i> the story instead of seeing it. On the
other hand, the sense appeal of the story may
have been that of <i>color</i>, of <i>food</i>&mdash;any sense
stimulus that routed from their brain corners
our old sense impressions and set them to working
again. And it is almost impossible to
gauge the effect upon cerebration of these
stored-up sensory images.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>That whiff of odor from a city flower cart
brings suddenly to my mind an incident that
I had not been cognizant of for years&mdash;the
memory of a certain long-ago day when I purloined
my Grandmother&#8217;s scissors and cut off
two of my curls to make a wig for a hairless
rag doll. What is the connection between this
day of badness of my childhood and a dingy
city flower wagon? Ah, I have it! There
was a pot of Martha Washington geraniums
in the room where I sat when I cut my hair.
My small, serge sleeve brushed the leaves as
I held the curls triumphantly to the light and
the pungent odor found a permanent place in
my mind, side by side with the other memory,
ineffaceable, always ready to produce a recall.</p>

<p>Dr. Van Dyke once said that if he were able
to paint a picture of Memory, he would picture
her asleep in a bed of mint. He illustrated
the value of sensory stimuli in fiction.
One gauge of a perfectly constructed piece of
fiction is its sense content. Does it include
such writing as will make the reader <i>see</i>, <i>taste</i>,
<i>smell</i> and <i>hear?</i> So, in stories for children we
must apply the same test.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><i>A child&#8217;s story, to interest, should have a
strong sense appeal.</i></p>

<p>Many of the old, handed-down jingles and
folk tales are full of <i>eating</i> and <i>drinking</i>,
<i>smelling</i> delectable odors, <i>hearing</i> the sounds
of child life and <i>seeing</i> over again child
scenes. Therein lies their world appeal and
the reason for their ancient and obvious popularity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>One might go on indefinitely quoting lines of
Mother Goose that tickle a child&#8217;s fancy and
are undying in their appeal for the sole reason
that they are sensual in the broader understanding
of the term. They include simple,
direct references to the mental concepts that
the child has gained through his senses.
Practically all that the normal, natural child
has accomplished, mentally, up to the age of
three or four years, has been to note bright
colors, to handle everything he has come in
contact with,&mdash;not, as so many persons suppose,
for purposes of mischievous destruction, but
rather to touch each object and make its feeling
an integral part of his ego,&mdash;to eat and drink
and to use his nostrils as a dog does. What
more natural than that his beginnings in English
should have for their basis a sense content
that will help the child to <i>name</i>, put into
words his previously acquired but unnamed
sense impressions?</p>

<p>Miss Emilie Poulsson&#8217;s finger plays for little
children have for their basic appeal the stimulating
of a child&#8217;s ability to recall previously
acquired sense impressions. In addition, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
finger movements with which the child illustrates
these rhymes give the added association
of the sense of touch to strengthen and vivify
the child&#8217;s interest in and memory of the rhyme
stories. To illustrate:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>As the child grows beyond the age when
Mother Goose and Finger Plays appeal to him,
he still finds his greatest interest in those stories
which stimulate his acquired sensory images.
The mental operation of apperception described
in the last chapter is so inclusive a
process, covering, as it must of necessity,
memory and perception, that it explains the appeal
of the sense story to the mind of a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Many of the stories quoted at the end of the
chapter as being of universal interest to all
children find their common points of interest
in their sense pictures, so quickly grasped and
so warmly welcomed by the child mind whose
sense doors are always flung wide open.</p>

<p>It is to be questioned whether or not the
story of &#8220;The Little Red Hen&#8221; would have
been awarded such immortality if its heroine
had been a plain <i>hen</i> and not <i>red</i>. Having
been dyed with the crimson pigment of the
imagination, however, by some old-world story
teller, she has taken her cheerful, cackling way
through the streets of childhood, an undying,
classic fowl of fiction because she is colored.
So it is with Elizabeth Harrison&#8217;s wonderful
allegory of &#8220;The Little Gray Grandmother.&#8221;
She might have been described in the story as
a spirit, a fairy, a mythical character who influenced
for good the lives of Wilhelm, Beata
and the others. But instead of <i>describing</i> her
invisibility&mdash;Miss Harrison <i>paints</i> it, colors
her story heroine with the shades of intangible
things. She is a little <i>gray</i> grandmother and
her clothes are sea fog and her veil is of smoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
She is an animated part of the seashore home
and is made of gray mist. What could be
more artistic than the sense appeal of this
story?</p>

<p>Why do children&mdash;all children&mdash;listen, gaping
and ecstatic, to the account of the many
and hazardous adventures of the Gingerbread
Boy? Why do they beg to have the story
told over again, even after they have heard it
so many times that they know it by heart. Its
universal popularity is not due to its folklore
quality. Neither is it due to its plot and treatment,
although these undoubtedly strengthen
it. Its big appeal, however, is to the child&#8217;s
sense of taste. The story arouses tasting images
in the child&#8217;s mind, that are pleasurable
and strong.</p>

<p>... &#8220;A chocolate jacket and cinnamon
seeds for buttons! His eyes were made of
fine, fat currants; his mouth was made of rose-colored
sugar and he had a gay little cap of
orange-sugar candy&#8221;&mdash;Sara Cone Bryant says
in describing her Gingerbread Man. So,
from this delectable, luscious paragraph about
his make-up, to the climax of the story when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Gingerbread Man is devoured by the fox,
the child hearers <i>eat</i> in imagination all the
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the Chimes Rang&#8221; makes a different
and more ethical sense appeal to the child&#8217;s
mind. The story stimulates in the listeners a
deep interest in the old chime of bells that has
hung silent for so long a time in the tower.
One longs to hear them and waits anxiously for
the miracle that will start their pealing. At
the story climax, when an unselfish offering
laid upon the altar works the wonder, it is possible
to listen, in imagination, to the bells&#8217;
sweet music.</p>

<p>But why make this sense appeal to the child
mind through the medium of a story, the story
teller asks?</p>

<p>There are two very real and definite uses to
which the sense story may be put.</p>

<p>Such sense stories as &#8220;The Little Red Hen,&#8221;
&#8220;The Gingerbread Boy&#8221; and many others of
similar character may be told not only to give
pleasure to the child of kindergarten age who
finds delight in their sensual content, but they
have a very real value in <i>resurrecting the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<i>dormant brain of a mentally deficient child</i>.
More and more attention is being given every
year to the education of the feeble-minded
child, both at home and in the public schools.
We are discovering that it is possible to rouse
to action a child&#8217;s sleeping brain by means of
intensive sense training. We are teaching
him to smell, taste, see color, discriminate
forms and textiles, to open the telegraphic circuit
of his senses. We are putting the world
of realities into the arms of the feeble-minded
child to touch, feel, taste, smell, see. So we
educate him, but we must carry out the same
system of sense training in his stories, selecting
for his hearing those stories that make verbal
and recall his previously acquired sense
impressions.</p>

<p>There is one other use to which we may put
the sense story. <i>It is a means of strengthening
any child&#8217;s imagination.</i> The same mental operation
by means of which a baby associates the
idea <i>cold</i> with a block of ice, helps the child to
feel the cold of Andersen&#8217;s &#8220;Little Match
Girl.&#8221; In the first instance the association of
<i>cold</i> and ice means self-preservation for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
baby. He wishes to avoid an unpleasant
sensation, so he does not touch the ice, but
his former experience of touching it has
left an ineffaceable image in his mind. In
the second instance, the image <i>cold</i> is recalled
in the mind of the child by the story and
the result is a very different mental process.
The child is able through the sensory stimulus
of the story to feel with the little match
girl, to put himself in her place, to understand
her condition, because it is brought to him in
a familiar term&mdash;<i>cold</i>.</p>

<p>The story teller who makes the wisest use of
the sense story sees to it that the color, sound,
taste or odor described in the story is used as
a <i>means to an end</i>. One does not wish to
stimulate sense images in a child&#8217;s mind for
the simple operation of &#8220;making his thinking
machine work&#8221; in old paths. What we must
do is to utilize his sense impressions to
strengthen new brain paths. Fortunately
nearly all of the stories for children that have
a sensory content utilize this mode of writing
to strengthen the climax of the story. It only
remains for the story teller to select her <i>color</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<i>sound</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>odor</i> or <i>touch</i> story to meet the
special needs of her children. The following
story is an excellent illustration of utilizing the
sense of taste to point a moral:</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Three Cakes</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little boy named
Henry, who was away from his home at a boarding
school.</p>

<p>He was a very special kind of boy, forever at
his book, and he happened once to get to the very
tip top of his class. His mother was told of it,
and when it came morning, she got up early and
went to speak with the cook as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cook, you are to make a cake for Henry,
who has been very good at school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart,&#8221; said the cook, and she
made a cake. It was as big as&mdash;let me see&mdash;as
big as the moon. It was stuffed with nuts, and
raisins, and figs, and candied fruit peel, and over
it all was an icing of sugar, thick, and smooth, and
very white. And no sooner was the cake home
from the baking than the cook put on her bonnet
and carried it to the school.</p>

<p>When Henry first saw it, he jumped up and
down. He was not patient enough to wait for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a knife, but he fell upon the cake tooth and nail.
He ate and ate until school began, and after
school was over he ate again with his might and
main. At night he ate until bedtime, and he put
the cake under his bolster when he went to bed
and he waked and waked a dozen times that he
might take a bite.</p>

<p>But the next day when the dinner bell rang,
Henry was not hungry, and was vexed to see how
heartily the other children ate. His friends asked
him if he would not play at cricket, tan, or kits.
Ah! Henry could not; so they played without him,
and Henry could scarcely stand upon his legs. He
went and sat down in a corner, and the head master
sent for the apothecary to come with all his
phials of physic. After some days Henry was
well again, but his mother said that she would
never let him have another cake.</p>

<p>Now there was another scholar in the same
school, whose name was Francis. He had written
his mother a very pretty letter without one
misspelled word or blot, and so his mother, like
the mother of Henry, sent him a great cake.</p>

<p>Francis decided that he would not be so unwise
as to follow the example of Henry, so he took the
cake, which was so heavy that he could hardly lift
it, and he watched to see that no one was looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and he slipped up to his chamber and put the cake
in his box under lock and key. Every day at
play time he used to slip away from his companions,
go upstairs on tiptoe, and cut off a tolerable
slice of his cake which he would eat by himself.
For a whole week did he keep this up, but alas&mdash;the
cake was so exceedingly large! At last the
cake grew dry, and quickly after it became moldy.
Finally the maggots got into it, and Francis, with
great reluctance, was obliged to throw it away.</p>

<p>There was a third little gentleman who went
to the same school as Henry and Francis, and
his name was Gratian. One day his mother,
whom he loved very dearly, sent him a cake because
she also loved him. No sooner had it arrived
than Gratian called his friends all about
him, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! Look at what my mother has sent
me. You must, each one, have a piece.&#8221; So
the children all got around the cake as bees resort
to a flower, just blown, and Gratian divided the
cake with a knife into as many pieces as he had
invited boys, with one piece over, for himself.
His own piece he said he would eat the next day,
and he began playing games with the boys.</p>

<p>But a very short time had passed, as they were
playing, when a poor man who was carrying a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
fiddle came into the school yard. He had a very
long, gray beard, and he was guided by a little
dog who went before him, for the old man was
blind.</p>

<p>The children noticed how dexterous was the little
dog in leading, and how he shook a bell which
hung underneath his collar, as if to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not throw down or run against my master!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the two had come into the yard, the old
man sat down upon a stone, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear little gentlemen, I will play you all
the pretty tunes that I know, if you will give me
leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children wished for nothing half so much
as to hear the music, so the old man put his violin
in tune and then played over jigs and tunes that
had been new in former times.</p>

<p>But Gratian, who was standing close to him,
noticed that while he played his jolliest airs, a
tear would often roll down his cheeks. And Gratian
asked him why he wept.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;I am hungry. I
have not any one in the world to feed me, or my
faithful dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Gratian felt like crying, too, and he ran
to fetch the cake which he had saved to eat himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
He brought it out with joy, and as he ran
along he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, good man, here is some cake for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Gratian put the cake into the old man&#8217;s
hands and he, laying down his fiddle, wiped his
eyes and began to eat. At every piece he put
into his mouth he gave a bit to his faithful little
dog, who ate from his hand; and Gratian, standing
by, had as much pleasure as if he had eaten
the cake himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>WHEN THE CURTAIN RISES</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A TIRED-OUT, unenthusiastic school
teacher in one of our large public
schools was recently endeavoring to secure the
attention of her class for a story. This story
hour was, for her, just one lap in the march of
the day&#8217;s routine, a period to be finished as soon
as possible, and she began it in a stereotyped
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to tell you a story, children,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and I want every child in the room to
sit up straight, put his feet <i>flat</i> on the floor and
fold his hands. When everybody is ready, I
will begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>In contrast one is reminded of another
teacher, who opened her story hour in a different
way. In point of fact, she did not really
<i>open</i> it at all in the formal understanding of
the word. Nor did she have any specified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
period of the day for telling stories. When
her class was fatigued and needed a note of
relaxation, when they were restless and needed
calming, when they seemed to need inspiration,
she gave the signal for books and pencils to be
put away and with no further introduction she
took the children with her to Story Land for a
space, <i>opening her story in so interesting a way</i>
that she compelled attention without asking
for it.</p>

<p>The instance of the first story teller is an
example of securing a child&#8217;s <i>voluntary attention</i>.</p>

<p>The second story teller illustrated a method
of securing a child&#8217;s <i>involuntary</i>, almost unconscious
<i>attention</i>.</p>

<p>Especially in the case of the little child who
is beginning his school work, and even up to
the more mature years of childhood, voluntary
attention, <i>that mental operation in which the
will is called upon to open the doors of the
senses and let in knowledge</i>, is almost too much
for us to ask of a child. The wonderful machinery
of the mind has provided another and
much more economic means of knowledge acquisition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<i>Certain mind stimuli will set the
whole wireless system of perception, association
and memory going</i> without any effort on
the part of the story teller save that of discovering
the stimuli. In other words, we must
secure <i>involuntary attention in children
through studying their interests</i>. The story
that opens with <i>headlines of child interest</i> as
compelling as those of one of our yellow news
sheets will hold a child&#8217;s attention without his
being in the least conscious of his attitude of
mind toward it. Voluntary attention, the
mind attitude toward a story that is brought
about by folded hands and straight backs, is
very likely to lapse, to develop a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
character and finally lose itself. <i>Concentrated attention
can be secured in children only
through the medium of appealing to child interest.</i></p>

<p>The successful story teller will bear in mind
the fact, in selecting stories to tell, that the
good story for children of any age, and adults
too, for that matter, should have one of the
qualities that characterize a successful drama.
<i>It must catch the attention of the audience the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<i>moment the curtain rises.</i> There must be no
long explanation, no descriptive scenes and
painful dragging in of the plot. Children do
not care a rap for the creating of atmosphere.
They do not care how long ago the story
events happened, or why they happened.
What they are eager for is a quick story appeal
made the second that the story curtain rolls up.</p>

<p><i>Each story told to children ought to be selected
having in mind its beginning.</i> The
story teller must ask herself another set of
questions:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Does the story interest begin with my first
paragraph, my first sentence, my first word?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Will the opening of my story find an apperceptive
basis for attention in the minds of my
children?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Has my story a sense appeal in the first
sentence?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Any one of these qualities of story opening
will help to win the sympathy of the child
audience and will find a ready response in involuntary
attention.</p>

<p>A class of little street boys waged continued
warfare upon one of the New York Settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Houses. They broke the windows, mobbed the
Settlement children and carefully evaded the
police. The Settlement story teller decided,
one night, to open the doors of the house to the
gang of boys and see if it would not be possible
to win them over to an interest in the work of
the Settlement and lead them to obey the laws
of society through stories. The boys entered
the building like a besieging army. They
shouted, stamped, stampeded into the room
that had been assigned them and throwing
down chairs and overturning tables they proceeded
to produce a scene of Bedlam. The
story teller made no effort to control the boys.
She secured for herself a place of vantage in
the center of the room. When there was an
instant&#8217;s lull in the uproar that the boys were
making, as they took breath for more rowdyism,
she said in a low, even tone of voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was once a little Indian boy who
rode fifty miles on the cow-catcher of an engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she waited and the boys waited, too,
breathlessly eager for her next words. When
she saw that she had caught the interest of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
audience, she proceeded with the story in the
same even, low voice, not so much telling the
boys a story, apparently, but just <i>telling a
story</i>, every sentence of which painted a word
picture and the whole being a graphic series
of moving pictures unrolled on a story film before
her audience. She gave the story facts
about the Indian lad who had never seen a locomotive
and stole a daring ride on one because
he thought it was a fire-horse. One by
one the boys seated themselves quietly on the
chairs or on the floor to listen. Several lay
flat upon the floor, crawling stealthily nearer
to the story teller as their interest in the story
deepened. Throughout the entire telling of
the story the room was absolutely still, and
when the climax came the boys asked for another
story. From that evening they were the
Settlement&#8217;s stanch allies.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible to secure the
voluntary attention of these boys. The fact
that some one wanted to tell them a story
would have probably inspired them to more
lawlessness. If the story teller had begun the
story after this fashion:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&#8220;Fifty years ago there were few railways in
the western part of our country. The prairies
were peopled by Comanche tribes who were
unfamiliar with the inventions of civilization,
and the first train that ran through an Indian
settlement inspired an Indian lad to a strange
deed&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<p>Not a boy would have listened. This form
of story beginning is <i>bad</i> and phenomenally
common in many stories for children. It is an
example of <i>words</i>, not <i>interest stimuli</i>. It explains
a story situation instead of <i>presenting</i>
it. A story to secure the involuntary attention
of children should have the quality of a crashing
orchestral overture, a thunder clap, a pistol
shot&mdash;so unexpected, compelling, and penetrating
will it be.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>There was once a little Indian boy who
rode fifty miles on the cow-catcher of an engine!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Could there be a more stimulating story beginning
for a group of boys than this? There
is an apperceptive appeal in the Indian lad.
He was not a man, not a chieftain, but just a little
lad like themselves. There is an immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sense appeal in the steam-engine image that
the story beginning brings to their minds.
Smoke, smell, bell ringing, whistle blowing,
steam escaping, and the rattle of iron wheels
on iron tracks are all recalled to a boy&#8217;s mind
in one glorious bit of imagination whose only
stimulus is the word <i>engine</i>. Then, to clinch
the apperceptive and sensory appeal of the
sentence, is the quick introduction of a new
story interest&mdash;the Indian boy did a deed that
they, in their wildest dreams, had never considered&mdash;he
rode an engine.</p>

<p>If a story, otherwise good, opens poorly&mdash;is
too wordy, too descriptive, too pedantic&mdash;study
the story carefully for its main interest
and, selecting just the right words to convey
this overture of interest, begin <i>there</i>. It will
be discovered that certain of the classic, favorite
tales of childhood fulfill this story test.
They open compellingly and carry the interest
that was stimulated in the first paragraph
clear through to the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were once five and twenty tin soldiers
who were all brothers, for they had been
made out of the same old tin spoon.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Hans Christian Andersen used the child&#8217;s
instinctive love of counting his toys, and a bit
of humor that tickles a child&#8217;s fancy, when he
wrote this opening paragraph of his wonderful
old allegory, &#8220;The Faithful Tin Soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time there lived a cat and a
parrot and they thought they would ask each
other to dinner, turn and turn about.&#8221;</p>

<p>This folk tale of &#8220;The Greedy Cat&#8221; opens
with a strong sense appeal. The children&#8217;s interest
aroused in the first sentence by means of
the progressive dinner arrangement of the famous
cat is sustained to the last word of the
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a wee little duck with a very long
tail, so he was called Drakestail. Now
Drakestail had some money of his very, very
own and the King asked if he might take it.
So Drakestail loaned all his money to the
King&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In this old folk tale, the gist of which is the
merry adventures of a duck, the story interest
begins with the first sentence. The children
are introduced, with no unnecessary preliminaries
of description or explanation to the hero,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Drakestail, and then they are plunged into the
story itself, interesting and direct in its appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some children were at play in their playground
one day, when a herald rode through
the town, blowing a trumpet and crying aloud:
&#8216;The King! The King is coming!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In this story, Laura E. Richards&#8217; &#8220;Coming
of the King,&#8221; to be found in her collection of
short stories, &#8220;The Golden Windows,&#8221; a strong
sense appeal commands the child&#8217;s involuntary
attention at the beginning of the story.
The familiar figures, children at play in their
playground, are introduced to the sound of a
trumpet&#8217;s call, instantly attracting the attention
of the child listeners.</p>

<p>Once the story teller has learned story selection,
having in mind a beginning that will
hold the attention of her audience from her
first word, her success will be secured. It is
also possible to carry this interest which has
been secured for the child the instant that the
curtain rolls up, straight through to the end
of the story, because of its compelling beginning.
The opening paragraph of a child&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
story should be the theme, tuned to the key and
melody of child interest about which and on
which the rest of the story plays. The noteworthy
dinner of the cat and the mouse forms
the keynote for the rest of the classic adventures
of the Greedy Cat. The &#8220;wee little
duck&#8221; and the avaricious old King whom we
meet in the first paragraph are the main actors
in the story drama of Drakestail. The playground
of the children that we see in the first
sentence of Mrs. Richards&#8217; &#8220;The Coming of
the King,&#8221; is the scene of a story miracle almost
unparalleled in short story writing for
children.</p>

<p><i>Cutting out unnecessary description, avoiding
any explanation as to why you are telling
the story, introducing your thunder clap, your
trumpet, your story hero in the first sentence</i>&mdash;this
is the way to begin a story.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince&#8217;s Visit,&#8221; by Horace Scudder, is
an excellent example of sustained story interest
brought about by means of a compelling
story opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Prince&#8217;s Visit</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a holiday in the city, for the Prince was
to arrive. As soon as the cannon should sound,
the people might know that the Prince had landed
from the steamer, and when they should hear the
bells ring that was as much as being told that the
Prince, dressed splendidly, and wearing a feather
in his cap, was actually on his way up the main
street of the city, seated in a carriage drawn by
four coal-black horses, and with the soldiers and
music going on before.</p>

<p>It was holiday in the workshops, too, and little
Job was listening for the cannon and the bells.
He was only a poor, foolish little lad, and he did
nothing all day long but turn the crank that worked
a great washing machine; but when he heard the
boom of the guns, he shuffled out and made his
way home.</p>

<p>Ever since he had heard of the Prince&#8217;s coming,
Job had dreamed of nothing else. He
bought a picture of the Prince and pinned
it up on the wall over his bed; and when he came
home at night, tired and hungry, he would sit
down by his mother, who mended holes in the
laundry clothes, and talk about the Prince until
he could keep his eyes open no longer; and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his mother would kiss him and send him to bed.</p>

<p>To-day he hurried so fast that he was quite out
of breath when he reached the old house where he
lived.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cannon went off, mother!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The
Prince is come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is ready, Job,&#8221; said his mother.
&#8220;You will find all your things in a row on the bed.&#8221;
And Job tumbled into his room to dress for the
holiday. Everything was there as his mother had
said; all the old things renewed, and all the new
things pieced together that she had worked on
so long, and every stitch of which Job had overlooked
and almost directed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it splendid?&#8221; he said as he looked at himself
in a mirror. Round his throat was a white
satin scarf that shone in contrast to his dingy coat,
and it was pinned with an old brooch which Job
treasured as the apple of his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only let me wear the feather, mother,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look splendidly, Job, and don&#8217;t need it,&#8221;
said she cheerfully; &#8220;and, besides, the Prince
wears one, and what would he think if he saw
you with one, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; said Job, and then he kissed
her and started off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe,&#8221; he said as he went up the
court, &#8220;that the Prince would mind my wearing
a feather; but mother didn&#8217;t want me to. Hark,
there are the bells! He must have started!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a long way from Job&#8217;s house to the main
street, and he would have to hurry if he were going
to see the grand procession. On he shambled,
knocking against the flag-stones, and nearly
falling down at every step. He was now in a
cross street, which would bring him before long
to the main street, and he even thought he
heard the distant music and the cheers of the
crowd.</p>

<p>But just then he stumbled upon something
which tripped him. He would have hurried on,
but he heard a cry, and a groan of pain. He
looked back, and he saw what he had stumbled
over. It was a poor beggar boy, without home
or friends, dirty and unsightly enough, and clad in
ragged clothing, and he was lying on the sidewalk,
too ill to move. As Job turned, the boy looked
up at him and stretched out his hands, but he was
too weak to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is sick!&#8221; said Job. &#8220;Hilloa!&#8221; but every
one was intent upon the procession, and no one
heard him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince is coming,&#8221; he said; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
turned as if to run. But the beggar would not
away from his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is sick,&#8221; said Job again, bending down, &#8220;I
will take him home to mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah! There he is! The
Prince! The Prince!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the carriage drawn by four coal-black horses
rode the Prince; and he was dressed in splendid
clothes and he wore a feather in his cap.</p>

<p>Job wiped the tears from his eyes as he heard
the music and the cheering so far away, but he
lifted the little beggar boy in his arms&mdash;and
started for home.</p>

<p>And as he passed along the street with his burden,
he heard a sound of beautiful music as if all
the angels were singing together, and he looked
up into the blue sky above the chimneys and roofs
of the city, and he saw the angels with the Prince
in the midst of them moving by, and they were all
smiling on him, poor, simple Job.</p>

<p>So Job saw the Prince pass, too.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>USING SUSPENSE TO DEVELOP CONCENTRATION</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BECAUSE we have discovered that a
story is able to do much for a child;
make him feel comfortable and at home in
a new environment because it brings to his
mind so compellingly the well-known and
loved surroundings of some former environment,
stimulate his senses to added activity,
and secure his involuntary attention, we are going
one step farther. We will make a fresh
discovery. We will find a story quality that
will develop sustained attention in children;
will give them the power to concentrate. Not
only will our story open with such a clarion
note of interest that it will compel involuntary
attention but after this overture, this
<i>crash</i> of interest, the perfect child&#8217;s story will
swing into a different sort of construction that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
will hold the attention secured by its previous
yellow headlines of interest.</p>

<p>One story quality more than any other develops
this sustained interest on the part of the
children who are listening to it&mdash;the <i>quality
of suspense</i>.</p>

<p>What is suspense?</p>

<p>It is so necessary a story quality that it seems
to explain itself. Suspense means, <i>making the
children wait for the rest of the story</i>. It
means that <i>the different scenes, the events that
go to make up the story, are told in the order
of their relative interest appeal to the child
mind</i>. The child listens, attends involuntarily
as the story proceeds because <i>he wants to know
what is coming next</i>. Each scene of the story
is unfinished for him; he must wait for a fulfillment
of what he expects, looks for, longs for
in the story. One sentence, one paragraph
makes him <i>curious</i> to hear the following one.
The story structure is like a child&#8217;s stringing
of beads. Upon a white thread of interest the
colored glass balls which go to make up the
whole circlet of the story plot are strung, as a
child would pick them out, each inadequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and incomplete without its component&mdash;one
bead slipped down to make a place for the next
one.</p>

<p><i>Suspense is the story quality that stimulates
curiosity and in this way develops concentrated
thinking on the part of the child.</i></p>

<p>Certain old folk stories have the quality of
suspense developed to a high degree and
through their accumulative, <i>building on</i>
character of construction compel every child&#8217;s
attention. It is wise to look for this quality in
selecting stories to tell to the very young child
whose ability to attend for any length of time
is undeveloped. Through the involuntary,
sustained interest he develops, through listening
to the story he becomes able to fix his
attention upon other human affairs. An old
nursery tale of New England, reported by
Clifton Johnson, illustrates with unusual vividness
the use of suspense in sustaining a
story interest that holds the attention of any
child up to the last word of the story.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Travels of a Fox</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A fox was digging behind a stump, and he
found a bumble-bee. The fox put the bumble-bee
in a bag and he traveled.</p>

<p>The first house he came to he went in, and he
said to the mistress of the house:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I leave my bag here while I go to
Squintum&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be careful not to open the bag,&#8221; said
the fox.</p>

<p>But as soon as the fox was out of sight, the
woman just took a little peep into the bag and out
flew the bumble-bee, and the rooster caught him
and ate him up.</p>

<p>After a while the fox came back. He took up
his bag and he saw that the bumble-bee was gone,
and he said to the woman:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my bumble-bee?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the woman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just untied the bag, and the bumble-bee flew
out, and the rooster ate him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the fox, &#8220;I must have the
rooster, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he caught the rooster and put him in his bag,
and traveled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>And the next house he came to he went in, and
said to the mistress of the house:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I leave my bag here while I go to
Squintum&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be careful not to open the bag,&#8221; said
the fox.</p>

<p>But as soon as the fox was out of sight, the
woman just took a little peep into the bag, and
the rooster flew out, and the pig caught him and
ate him up.</p>

<p>After a while the fox came back, and he took
up his bag and he saw that the rooster was not in
it, and he said to the woman: &#8220;Where is my
rooster?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the woman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just untied the bag, and the rooster flew out,
and the pig ate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the fox, &#8220;I must have the pig,
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he caught the pig and put him in his bag,
and traveled.</p>

<p>And the next house he came to he went in, and
he said to the mistress of the house:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I leave my bag here while I go to
Squintum&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8220;Then be careful not to open the bag,&#8221; said
the fox.</p>

<p>But as soon as the fox was out of sight, the
woman just took a little peep into the bag, and
the pig jumped out, and the ox ate him.</p>

<p>After a while the fox came back. He took up
his bag and he saw that the pig was gone, and he
said to the woman:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my pig?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the woman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just untied the bag, and the pig jumped out,
and the ox ate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the fox, &#8220;I must have the ox,
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he caught the ox and put him in his bag, and
traveled.</p>

<p>And the next house he came to he went in, and
he said to the mistress of the house:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I leave my bag here while I go to
Squintum&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be careful not to open the bag,&#8221; said
the fox.</p>

<p>But as soon as the fox was out of sight, the
woman just took a little peep into the bag, and
the ox got out, and the woman&#8217;s little boy chased
him away off over the fields.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>After a while the fox came back. He took up
his bag, and he saw that the ox was gone, and he
said to the woman:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my ox?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the woman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just untied the string, and the ox got out,
and my little boy chased him away off over the
fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the fox, &#8220;I must have the little
boy, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he caught the little boy and he put him in his
bag, and he traveled.</p>

<p>And the next house he came to he went in, and
he said to the mistress of the house:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I leave my bag here while I go to
Squintum&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be careful not to open the bag,&#8221; said
the fox.</p>

<p>The woman was making cake, and her children
were around her asking for some.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, give me a piece,&#8221; said one; and,
&#8220;Oh, mother, give me a piece,&#8221; said the others.</p>

<p>And the smell of the cake came to the little
boy who was weeping and crying in the bag, and
he heard the children asking for cake and he said:
&#8220;Oh, mammy, give me a piece.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Then the woman opened the bag and took the
little boy out, and she put the house-dog in the bag
in the little boy&#8217;s place. And the little boy
stopped crying and had some cake with the others.</p>

<p>After a while the fox came back. He took up
his bag and he saw that it was tied fast, and he
put it over his back and traveled far into the deep
woods. Then he sat down and untied the bag,
and if the little boy had been there in the bag
things would have gone badly with him.</p>

<p>But the little boy was safe in the woman&#8217;s
house, and when the fox untied the bag the house-dog
jumped out and ate him all up.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The point of interest for children in this
story lies in their wonder as to what is going
to happen next. It begins with a note of the
unusual.</p>

<p>&#8220;How strange for a fox to put a bumble bee
in a bag,&#8221; the children say. &#8220;Will the next
sentence tell us why he did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a number of questions present themselves
to the child mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the woman untie the bag?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&#8220;Will the person at <i>this</i> house do the same
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that <i>every</i> woman will open
the bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another series of questions confronts the
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;What manner of beast will the fox take at
<i>this</i> house and put in his bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the suspense is sustained until the
children&#8217;s curiosity is satisfied at the end of the
story. Not alone has the story been a bit of
mental gymnastics for the child, it has given
him added mental power in the listening.
Above and behind the mental process of waiting
to see what unusual and unexpected scene
of the story drama will be presented to him
next, <i>he has been exercising his will in concentrating
upon the process of waiting</i>. His
power of sustained attention has been strengthened
materially and ineffaceably.</p>

<p>For the very young child, the suspensive element
in story telling must be very simple. It
will consist often in <i>repetition</i>, the pleasureable
recurrence in the story of certain <i>sounds</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that the child likes and is willing to wait for&mdash;sort
of half way houses on the story road
they are, where his mind wheels may stop and
rest awhile&mdash;sign posts that lead the way to
the end of the road. Sometimes this story suspense
for the little folks is brought about
through a jingle introduced into the story and
repeated with certain changes as in the old
folk tale of &#8220;The Cat and the Mouse.&#8221; Again
suspense is brought about by means of a
change of intonation on the part of the story
teller. She adapts her voice to the needs of
the story as in &#8220;The Three Bears&#8221; to the inexpressible
delight of the children. This is a
primitive sort of suspense quality to be found
in the most elemental stories for children but
it has its important place in the discipline of
the child mind. The little child&#8217;s first attempts
to attend have a butterfly quality.
His mind flies from one stimulus to another
with no very long stop anywhere. This is as
it should be, for the world of sensations in
which the child is plunged as an <i>ego</i> is a varied,
crowded world and there is temptation
offered him to sip each flower, smell each new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
odor, touch everything and see everything with
which he comes in contact. But a suspensive
story holds him to one related set of images
for a brief space and through this concentration,
however simple it may be, he is developing
the power of willed attention.</p>

<p>As children grow older, the suspense quality
for which we must look in their stories will not
consist in <i>repetition of sounds, jingles and
phrases</i>, but in their <i>sequence of events leading
toward some unknown climax</i>. This is a
more difficult and subtle form of suspense to
secure. Here, the beads are strung upon their
thread, not in groups of white interspersed
with occasional red ones, but rather in the order
of the rainbow in bands of color that
complement and complete each other. Any
description of this more highly developed suspensive
story would be absolutely inadequate,
for the quality has to be <i>felt</i> by the story teller
first and then <i>felt for</i> by her.</p>

<p>An adapted version of the story of the first
meeting of John Ridd and Lorna Doone taken
from the novel, &#8220;Lorna Doone,&#8221; gives an illuminating
exemplification of the kind of suspense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that holds a child breathless, <i>waiting for
the unknown something that is to follow</i>. The
story teller should endeavor to discover and
introduce some suspense, either elemental, as
in the case of the folk tale, or of the more elusive
quality, illustrated in this story, into all
her stories.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Little Lorna Doone</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost everybody knows how pleasant and soft
the fall of land is round about Plover&#8217;s Barrows
Farm. There are trees and bright green grass
and orchards full of contentment, and you can
scarce espy the brook, although you hear it everywhere.
But it is there, where the valley bends
and the stream goes along with it, and pretty
meadows slope their breast, and the sun spreads
on the water. And nearly all the land until you
come to Nicholas Snow&#8217;s belonged to the Ridd
farm&mdash;to little John Ridd&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>John&#8217;s mother had long been ailing and not
well able to eat much. Now John chanced to
remember that once at the time of the holidays
he had brought his dear mother from Tiverton a
jar of pickled loaches; and she had said that in
all her life she had never tasted anything fit to be
compared with them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>So, one St. Valentine&#8217;s Day, in the forenoon,
without saying a word to any one, John started
away to get some loaches for his mother just to
make her eat a bit.</p>

<p>It was a bitter cold day, but John doffed his
shoes and hose and put them in a bag about his
neck, and left his little coat at home that he might
walk better. When he had traveled two miles or
so he found a good stream flowing softly into the
body of the brook. The water was freezing, and
John&#8217;s toes were aching, and he drew up on the
bank and rubbed them well with a sprout of young
sting-nettle, and having skipped about a little was
inclined to eat a bit. As he ate, his spirits rose,
so he put the bag round his neck again and buckled
his breeches far up from the knee, and crossing
the brook, went stoutly up under the branches
which hung so dark on the Bagworthy River.</p>

<p>The day was falling fast behind the brown of
the hilltops, and the trees seemed giants ready to
beat the boy. And every moment as the sky was
clearing up for a white frost, the cold of the water
underfoot on the fells got worse and worse,
until John was fit to cry with it. And so, in a
sorry plight, he came to an opening in the bushes
where a great black pool lay in front, whitened
at the sides with foam froth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>The boy shuddered, and drew back, not at the
pool itself, but at the whirling manner and wisping
of white threads upon it in circles, round and
round; and the center, black as jet. He did not
stop to look much for fear, though, but crawled
along over the fork of rocks where the water had
scooped the stone out, and shunning the ledge
from whence it rose like the mane of a white
horse into the broad black pool, softly he let
his feet slip into the dip and rush of the
torrent.</p>

<p>But John had reckoned without his host, for
the green waves came down like great bottles
upon him, and his legs were gone from under him
in a minute. He was borne up upon a rock, and
he won a footing, but there was no choice left except
to climb somehow up that hill of water or else
be washed down into the pool and whirl around
until it drowned him, for there was no chance of
going back by the way he had come down. So
John started carefully, step by step, stopping to
hold on by the cliff when he found a resting place,
and pant a while. But the greatest danger came
when he saw no jeopardy, but ran up a patch of
black ooze weed which stuck out in a boastful
manner not far from the summit. Here he fell,
and was like to have broken his knee cap, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
elbow caught in a hole in the rock and so he managed
to start again.</p>

<p>But the little boy was in a most dreadful fright
now, and at last the rush of water drove him back
again into the middle. Then he made up his
mind to die at last; only it did seem such a pity
after fighting so long, to give in. The light was
coming upon him, and again he fought toward it,
when suddenly he felt fresh air, and fell into it
headlong.</p>

<p>When John came to himself, his hands were
full of young grass and mold, and a little girl was
kneeling at his side and rubbing his forehead tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad,&#8221; she whispered softly, as John
opened his eyes and looked at her. &#8220;Now you
will try to be better, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little boy had never heard so sweet a sound
as came from between her red lips while she
knelt and gazed at him; nor had he ever seen
anything so beautiful as the large dark eyes, full
of pity and wonder. His eyes wandered down
the black shower of her hair; and where it fell on
the turf, among it, like an early star, was the first
primrose of the season.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; she said, &#8220;and how did
you come here? Oh, how your feet are bleeding!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
I must tie them up for you. And no
shoes or stockings! Is your mother very poor,
boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said John, a little vexed. &#8220;We are rich
enough to buy all this great meadow if we choose.
Here are my shoes and stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they are quite as wet as your feet. Oh,
please let me manage them. I will do it very
softly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind that,&#8221; said John, &#8220;but how
you are looking at me. I never saw any one like
you before. My name is John Ridd. What is
your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lorna Doone,&#8221; she answered in a low voice
as if afraid of it, and hanging her head so he could
see only her forehead and eyelashes; &#8220;if you
please, my name is Lorna Doone, and I thought
you must have known it,&#8221; and her blushes turned
to tears and her tears to long, low sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; said John, &#8220;whatever you do. I
will give you all my fish, Lorna, and catch some
more for my mother; only don&#8217;t be angry with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Young and harmless as she was, her name
alone made guilt of her; yet there was John, a
yeoman&#8217;s son, and there was she, a little lady born.
Though her hair had fallen down, and some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
her frock was touched with wet, behold, her dress
was pretty enough for the queen of all the angels.
All from her waist to her neck was white,
plaited in close like a curtain, and the dark soft
tresses of her hair, and the shadowy light of her
eyes made it seem yet whiter.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why did you ever come here?
Do you know what the robbers would do to us if
they found you here with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beat us, I dare say,&#8221; said John, &#8220;or me at
least. They could never beat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they would kill us both, and bury us here
by the water because you have found your way
up here. Now please go; oh, please go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw any one like you, Lorna, and I
must come back again to-morrow, and so must
you. I will bring you such lots of things&mdash;there
are apples still&mdash;and I caught a thrush&mdash;and I
will bring you the loveliest dog&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221;</p>

<p>A shout came down the valley, and Lorna&#8217;s
face was full of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see that hole?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>It was a niche in the rock which skirted
the meadow. In the fading twilight John could
just see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; She could hardly speak from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
terror. &#8220;There is a way out from the top of it;
they would kill me if I told of it. Oh, here they
come; I can see them!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little maid turned white as the snow which
hung on the rocks above her, and she looked at
the water and then at John. She began to sob
aloud, but John drew her behind the bushes and
close down to the water. Crouching in that hollow
nest they saw a dozen fierce men come down
on the other side of the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queen! Queen!&#8221; they were shouting here
and there, and now and then. &#8220;Where is our little
queen gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They always call me &#8216;queen,&#8217; and I shall have
to be their queen by and by,&#8221; Lorna whispered.
&#8220;Oh, they are crossing, and they are sure to see
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get down into the water,&#8221; said John,
&#8220;and you must go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw in a moment how to do it, and there
was no time to lose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now mind you, never come again,&#8221; she whispered
over her shoulder as she crept away, &#8220;only
I shall come sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>John crept into the water and lay down with his
head between two blocks of stone, and all this
time the robbers were shouting so that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
rocks round the valley rang. The boy was desperate
between fear and wretchedness till he
caught sight of the little maid, but he knew that
for her sake he must be brave and hide himself.</p>

<p>Lorna was lying beneath a rock not far away,
feigning to be fast asleep. Presently one of the
robbers came upon her, and he stopped and gazed
awhile at her fairness and innocence. Then he
caught her up in his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here our queen is! Here&#8217;s the captain&#8217;s
daughter,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;fast asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>He set her dainty little form upon his great
square shoulder, and her narrow feet in one broad
hand; and so he marched away with the purple
velvet of her skirt ruffling his long black beard,
and the silken length of her hair fetched out, like
a cloud of the wind behind her.</p>

<p>John crept into a bush for warmth, and then, as
daylight sank beneath the forget-me-not of stars,
he knew that it was time to get away, and he managed
to crawl from the bank to the niche in the
cliff that Lorna had shown him. How he climbed
up, and crossed the clearing, and found his
way home across the Bagworthy forest was more
than he could remember afterward, because of his
weariness.</p>

<p>All the supper was in, and the men sitting at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the white table with Annie and Lizzie near by&mdash;and
all were eager to begin, save only the mother.
John was of a mind to stay out in the dark by the
woodstack, being so late, but the way his mother
was looking out of the doorway got the better of
him, so he went inside and ate his supper, and
held his tongue as to where he had been all day
and evening. But if he had been of a mind he
could have told them many things.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Little In-a-Minute</span></h3>

<p class="center"><small>ILLUSTRATING STORY SUSPENSE WHICH APPEALS
TO YOUNGEST CHILDREN</small></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The big, yellow Sun smiled down upon them
and the Singing Brook hummed pretty little tunes
for them to listen to. They were two little boys
at play with a whole, long beautiful day ahead.</p>

<p>They looked almost exactly alike, did these two
little boys. Bobby wore a wide-brimmed sun hat
with a blue band around it, and Dicky wore a wide-brimmed
sun hat with a red band around it.
Bobby wore a brown linen sailor suit with blue
anchors on the collar and Dicky wore a brown linen
sailor suit with red anchors on the collar. Bobby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had a beautiful toy ship to play with, and Dicky
had a beautiful ship, too. As for the ships, <i>they</i>
looked <i>just</i> exactly alike. Each beautiful toy ship
was painted white and green, and each had a
big white sail as wide and pretty as a dove&#8217;s wing,
and each had a strong little rudder painted
red.</p>

<p>Bobby and Dicky had made a make-believe
wharf in the Singing Brook of sticks and stones
and nice black mud. There, anchored at the
wharf, lay the two beautiful toy boats, their white
sails flapping and fat with wind. When their
strings were loosed from the wharf, the Whispering
Wind would carry the two little boats way, way
down the Singing Brook to another little make-believe
wharf made of sticks and stones and nice
black mud that Bobby and Dicky had made farther
on.</p>

<p>So the Sun smiled down more happily and the
Singing Brook sang a merrier tune than the last
one and Bobby and Dicky began to play.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to load my boat with little green
apples, Dicky,&#8221; said Bobby. &#8220;Perhaps the Old
Chipmunk who lives at the foot of the Pine Tree
will go aboard and unload them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bobby began gathering small green apples as
fast as he could and putting them on the deck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his little ship, but Dicky sat on the bank of the
Singing Brook, doing nothing and only watching.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to load your ship, Dicky?&#8221;
Bobby asked as he put in the last apples.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute,&#8221; Dicky answered, but before the
minute had gone, Bobby&#8217;s ship, its white sail flying,
had started down the Singing Brook to the other
wharf. Dicky jumped up and loosed his boat
from its moorings, but it was very far behind
Bobby&#8217;s all the way. The two little boys hurried
softly between the willow trees that stood along
the edge of the Singing Brook. As they came to
the other make-believe wharf they saw the Old
Chipmunk creep out of his house at the foot of
the Pine Tree and go out on the wharf to wait
for the little ship to come in. When it came, he
unloaded all the cargo of apples and carried them
over to his cellar. But when Dicky&#8217;s ship came
in, so late and so empty, the Old Chipmunk did
nothing but smell of it. Then he sat on the end
of the make-believe wharf in the sunshine and
basked and did not even look at Dicky&#8217;s ship again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of something very nice to do,
now,&#8221; said Bobby as the two little boys carried
their ships back again. &#8220;We will play that the
flowers are children and we will give them a ride
in our ships.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, we will!&#8221; agreed Dicky.</p>

<p>So Bobby picked many little flower children;
clovers in pink bonnets and buttercups in wide yellow
hats and daisies in gold bonnets with white
strings, and he put them all carefully aboard his
ship. But Dicky only stood by in the grass and
watched.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to fill your boat with
flowers, Dicky?&#8221; Bobby asked as he helped the
last flower child aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute,&#8221; Dicky answered, but just then
down the Singing Brook came the Whispering
Wind. It filled the little white sails and away
sailed the two little ships, the flower children
aboard Bobby&#8217;s fluttering and dancing with the joy
of having a boat ride.</p>

<p>The two little boys raced along the bank to
watch and they saw a wonderful thing happen.
All the way down the Singing Brook, pretty passengers
joined the flower children on board Bobby&#8217;s
ship. A gold butterfly fluttered down to the deck
with his yellow and black wings, kissing the clovers
beneath their pink bonnets. A shiny black bumble
bee tumbled down to the deck with his gold, gossamer
wings and began to drone summer stories to
the buttercups. A silver dragon fly darted down
to the ship with his rainbow tinted wings to mend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the white strings of the daisies&#8217; caps which had been
torn by the frolicsome Whispering Wind. When
Bobby&#8217;s ship reached the other wharf it looked like
an excursion boat, but, ah, Dicky&#8217;s ship was quite
empty. There had been no flower children on
board to call the butterflies, the bumble bees and
the dragon flies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the nicest play of all, now,&#8221; said
Bobby after he had helped the flower children from
his ship and put their feet in the Singing Brook
that they might wade there all the rest of the day
and keep cool and fresh and sweet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will take our ships back, Dicky, and have
a race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be nice!&#8221; Dicky answered, so the
two little boys carried the two ships back and
launched them, side by side, in the Singing Brook.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>One</i>&mdash;<i>two</i>&mdash;&#8221; began Bobby, but before he said
<i>three</i> he heard their mother&#8217;s voice floating over
the fields and as far as their playground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bobby, Dicky, come home,&#8221; their mother
called. &#8220;Come home, boys, dinner is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming, mother,&#8221; Bobby called back, putting
his hand to his mouth to make a horn. Then
he turned to Dicky who still bent low over the bank
of the Singing Brook and still held in his hand the
string that was tied to the rudder of his ship.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;In a minute,&#8221; Dicky answered. Bobby ran off
over the fields, and soon he was out of sight. He
knew that there were fat white potatoes and yellow
chicken meat and red cherry dumplings for dinner.
Now they were hot, but they would be cold if he
did not hurry.</p>

<p>Down by the Singing Brook Dicky waited to
launch his ship once more. The Whispering Wind
filled the sail a third time, and away sailed the
beautiful little toy ship, so pretty with its green and
white paint, and its rudder that was painted red.
Dicky ran along beside it, to see how fast it sailed.
Faster and faster sailed Dicky&#8217;s ship. It did not
stop when it came to the Pine Tree where the Old
Chipmunk was busy in his cellar sorting out his
apples. It did not stop when it came to the Wading
Pool where all the flower children stood, keeping
cool and fresh and sweet. On and on sailed
the little ship, for the Whispering Wind was taking
it a long, long way off to the place where the Singing
Brook loses itself in the River and the River
goes on down to the Sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back. Oh, do come back!&#8221; called Dicky
to the little ship, but the ship only sailed the faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Please</i> come back!&#8221; cried Dicky as his beautiful
ship sailed out of sight.</p>

<p><i>In a minute</i>, the Whispering Wind called back.</p>

<p>But the little ship never came back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>So Dicky went slowly across the field and home
to dinner, but when he reached home what do you
think had happened?</p>

<p>The fat, white potatoes, the yellow chicken meat
and the red cherry dumplings were <i>cold</i>.</p>

<small>STORY CLIMAX</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WE have found it helpful to liken the effect
that a well-written, well-told story
has upon a child&#8217;s mind to the appeal that
a successful drama makes to an audience. We
have discovered that the opening paragraph,
the first sentence of a child&#8217;s story should have
the quality that characterizes the scene disclosed
on the stage when the curtain rolls up&mdash;<i>compelling
interest</i>. Following this curtain
raising of the story, there should be a series of
pictorial scenes that carry the events that go to
make up the story plot, strung upon a slender
thread of curiosity, and giving the element of
suspense to the story.</p>

<p>Following out this story structure we come,
eventually, to the end. The curtain must fall
at last before the eyes of the child audience
and the closing of the story drama should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as mind stimulating as was its beginning.
This is brought about by studying carefully
the story climax.</p>

<p><i>The climax of a story should be a complete
surprise to the listener and to the characters
in the story, as well.</i></p>

<p>This quick note of the unexpected coming
with compelling suddenness at the end of our
story clinches the interest of the plot and makes
the story indelible on the child&#8217;s mind sheet.</p>

<p>Certain well-known instances of climax as
exemplified in child stories will clarify for us
its <i>surprise</i> quality.</p>

<p>In one of the older plantation folk tales, Mr.
Elephant and Mr. Frog are pictured as being
good friends until Mr. Hare taunts them
with their dissimilarity in size and says that
Mr. Frog has boasted of the fact that Mr. Elephant
is his &#8220;riding horse.&#8221; Then the story
continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Fox and Mr. Tiger and Mr. Lion all
followed after Mr. Hare, crying: &#8216;Oho, oho, Mr.
Elephant is little Mr. Frog&#8217;s riding horse.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;Then Mr. Elephant turned around and he said
in a very gruff voice to Mr. Frog:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Did you tell them, grandson, that I was your
horse?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Frog said in a high, squeaky voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, no, grandfather.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But all the time Mr. Frog was thinking of a
trick to play on Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next day, Mr. Elephant and Mr. Frog
started off for a long walk. Mr. Frog had heard
of a place where the swamps were deep and muddy.
Mr. Elephant knew a place where the bananas
grew ripe and thick. And they spent a pleasant
day. On the way home Mr. Frog hopped up close
to Mr. Elephant, and he said in his high, squeaky
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Grandfather, I have no strength to walk.
Let me get up on your back.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Climb up, my grandson,&#8217; said Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>&#8220;He put his trunk down for a ladder, and Mr.
Frog climbed up. They had not gone very far
when Mr. Frog hopped up close to Mr. Elephant&#8217;s
ear, and he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am going to fall, grandfather. Give me
some small cords from the roadside that I may
bind your mouth, and hold myself upon your back.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;I will, grandson,&#8217; said Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Mr. Elephant stripped some small cords
from a birch tree by the roadside, and handed
them to Mr. Frog. Then Mr. Frog bound Mr.
Elephant&#8217;s mouth, and they went on a little farther.
It was not long, though, before Mr. Frog spoke
again to Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Grandfather,&#8217; he said, &#8216;find me a small green
twig that I may fan the mosquitoes from your
ears.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will, grandson,&#8217; said Mr. Elephant, so he
broke a small, green twig from the birch tree, and
reached it up to Mr. Frog; and just then they came
toward home.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;See Mr. Elephant,&#8217; cried Mr. Hare.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;See Mr. Elephant,&#8217; cried Mr. Tiger.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;See Mr. Elephant,&#8217; cried Mr. Lion, and all
the others, &#8216;Mr. Elephant is Mr. Frog&#8217;s horse.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Elephant turned himself about, and he
saw Mr. Frog on his back, holding the reins and
the whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, so I am, grandson,&#8217; said Mr. Elephant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Mr. Frog jumped down to the ground,
and he laughed and he laughed until he nearly split
his coat, because he had played a trick on Mr. Elephant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>This quotation serves very well to illustrate
perfect story climax. In the beginning of the
story, an apparently impossible situation was
suggested. To the child listener it seems incredible
that an elephant could so far forget
his dignity as to serve as the steed of a frog.
To the elephant himself, as well, this situation
appears to be incompatible with his social
status in the jungle. As the story advances,
each scene prepares a way for the unexpected
<i>dénouement</i> and the climax is found in the
surprise to the hearers and to Mr. Elephant as
well when the curtain falls upon him unwittingly
playing the part of &#8220;riding horse&#8221; to little
Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s inimitable allegory
of &#8220;The Ugly Duckling&#8221; owes a measure,
at least, of its popularity to its perfect climax.
In the beautiful word pictures of the story we
follow its hero, the Ugly Duckling, through
his series of perilous and sorrowful adventures,
sympathizing with but not anticipating the outcome
of them. In no single one of the scenes
of the story do we have a hint of the glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ending of the hero&#8217;s journeying. Finally
comes a quick, artistic curtain falling:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&mdash;&#8220;Then he flew toward the beautiful swans.
As soon as they saw him they rushed to meet him
with outstretched wings.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kill me!&#8217; said the Ugly Duckling; but as he
bent his head, what did he see reflected in the
water? It was his own image&mdash;not a dark, gray
bird, ugly to see&mdash;but a graceful swan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the great swans swam around him
and stroked his neck with their beaks for a
welcome. Some little children came into the
garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;See,&#8217; they cried, clapping their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A new swan has come and he is more beautiful
than the others!&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>This story climax is perfect, also, because it
carries the element of surprise to the story
hearers and the story hero, the Ugly Duckling,
as well.</p>

<p>It seems to be almost impossible to find many
instances of well constructed climax in the
short story for children. The story teller
must look for climax and in the event of not
being able to find it in the story that she selects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for telling, it will be necessary for her to make
over her story ending that it may be a complete
surprise to her listeners, in this way strengthening
the plot greatly. Many stories just <i>stop</i>,
giving one a feeling of dissatisfaction. There
has been no climax to make of the whole a
finished picture, complete in its minutest detail
of light and shade and forming an unerasable
vignette, on the child&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p><i>Climax knots the thread of the narrative.</i></p>

<p>Certain child stories, however, stand out as
illuminating instances of what climax means
in deepening the mental appeal for the child,
<i>etching</i> the story picture, so to speak. Nathaniel
Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;Great Stone Face,&#8221;
forms one instance. A careful reading of the
story will disclose Hawthorne&#8217;s subtle use of
suspense, the art of &#8220;making his audience wait&#8221;
for his <i>dénouement</i>. He makes us see the fertile
valley beneath the great mountain upon
whose side there had been sculptured by Nature,
the wonderful stone face. We are carried,
breathlessly, along upon the tide of the
narrative through the boy Ernest&#8217;s longing to
bear the image of these beautiful features, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
futile attempts of old Gathergold, old Blood-and-Thunder
and the others to prove their
likeness to the Great Stone Face until we reach
our climax in Ernest&#8217;s own transformation into
the great likeness unsuspected by himself or by
us.</p>

<p>It seems to be the great short story writers,
only, who have given us really illuminating instances
of climax&mdash;surprise ending&mdash;in stories
that will appeal to children in a stimulating
way. In Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;Snow Image&#8221; the curtain
falls upon a <i>surprise</i> situation. Oscar
Wilde leaves us unconsolable at his apparent
ending of &#8220;The Happy Prince.&#8221; The little
swallow is dead and the Prince has given away
his gold and jewels.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;So they pulled down the statue of the Happy
Prince who was no longer beautiful and so no
longer useful and they melted the statue in the
furnace.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What a strange thing!&#8217; said the overseer of
the workmen at the foundry. &#8216;This broken lead
heart will not melt in the furnace. We must
throw it away!&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead
swallow was also lying.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>But as we hold our breath, the climax is
flung gloriously out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bring me the two most precious things in the
City,&#8217; said God to one of His Angels and the
Angel brought him the leaden heart and the dead
bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have rightly chosen,&#8217; said God, &#8216;for in
my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing
for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy
Prince shall praise me.&#8217;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In the story of Cosette and her doll in &#8220;Les
Misérables,&#8221; Victor Hugo has given us a complete
story vignette with a perfectly developed
climax of surprise as Jean Valjean gives to
Cosette, the &#8220;toad&#8221; of Madame Thenardier&#8217;s
Kitchen, the doll about which she had
dreamed. Laura Richard&#8217;s short stories for
children abound in instances of illuminating
climax&mdash;no hint of the story ending being
given until the curtain falls. Her story of
&#8220;The Golden Windows&#8221; in which a little boy
sets out upon a journey to find the windows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
gold that he sees beyond the village from his
own poor little home and discovers at the end
of the day that his own home windows, viewed
from a distance are gold and those he has
found are gray and dull, is an example of Mrs.
Richards&#8217; skilled use of climax to force her
story point into the child&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>The mental appeal of climax is a very real
and vital one for the consideration of the story
teller. Once we fix in our minds the two
characteristics of artistic story ending, <i>surprise
to the story characters and to the children, and
an ending that ties the knot of the narrative</i>,
our story curtain will fall, leaving the children
a lap farther along in their mental development
than they were when the curtain rose.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Old Man Rabbit&#8217;s Thanksgiving Dinner</span></h3>

<p class="center"><small>ILLUSTRATING STORY CLIMAX WHICH APPEALS TO
YOUNGEST CHILDREN</small></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Man Rabbit sat at the door of his little
house eating a nice, ripe, juicy turnip. It was a
cold, frosty day, but Old Man Rabbit was all
wrapped up, round and round and round, with
yards and yards and yards of his best red wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
muffler so he didn&#8217;t care if the wind whistled
through his whiskers and blew his ears up straight.
Old Man Rabbit had been exercising, too, and that
was another reason why he was so nice and warm.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he had started off, lippity,
clippity down the little brown path that lay in front
of his house and led to Farmer Dwyer&#8217;s corn patch.
The path was all covered with shiny red leaves.
Old Man Rabbit scuffled through them and he carried
a great big bag over his back. In the corn
patch he found two or three fat, red ears of corn
that Farmer Dwyer had missed so he dropped them
into his bag. A little farther along he found some
purple turnips and some yellow carrots and quite a
few russet apples that Farmer Dwyer had arranged
in little piles in the orchard. Old Man Rabbit
went in the barn, squeezing under the big front
door by making himself very flat, and he filled all
the chinks in his bag with potatoes and he took a
couple of eggs in his paws, for he thought that he
might want to stir up a little pudding for himself
before the day was over.</p>

<p>Then Old Man Rabbit started off home again
down the little brown path, his mouth watering
every time his bag bumped against his back and
not meeting any one on the way because it was so
very, very early in the morning. When he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to his little house he emptied his bag and arranged
all his harvest in piles in his front room; the corn
in one pile, and the carrots in one pile, the turnips
in another pile, and the apples and potatoes in the
last pile. He beat up his eggs and stirred some
flour with them and filled it full of currants to make
a pudding. And when he had put his pudding in a
bag and set it boiling on the stove, he went outside
to sit awhile and eat a turnip, thinking all the time
what a mighty fine old rabbit he was and so clever,
too.</p>

<p>Well, while Old Man Rabbit was sitting there
in front of his little house, wrapped up in his red
muffler and munching the turnip, he heard a little
noise in the leaves. It was Billy Chipmunk traveling
home to the stone wall where he lived. He
was hurrying and blowing on his paws to keep them
warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Billy Chipmunk,&#8221; said Old
Man Rabbit. &#8220;Why are you running so fast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am cold, and I am hungry,&#8221; answered
Billy Chipmunk. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a hard
winter, a very hard winter&mdash;no apples left. I&#8217;ve
been looking all the morning for an apple and I
couldn&#8217;t find one.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that, Billy Chipmunk went chattering
by, his fur standing out straight in the wind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>No sooner had he passed than Old Man Rabbit
saw Molly Mouse creeping along through the little
brown path, her long gray tail rustling the red
leaves as she went.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Molly Mouse,&#8221; said Old Man
Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; answered Molly Mouse in a
wee little voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look a little unhappy,&#8221; said Old Man Rabbit,
taking another bite of his turnip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been looking and looking for an ear of
corn,&#8221; said Molly Mouse in a sad little chirping
voice. &#8220;But the corn has all been harvested. It&#8217;s
going to be a very hard winter, a very hard winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Molly Mouse trotted by out of sight.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, Old Man Rabbit heard somebody
else coming along by his house. This time it was
Tommy Chickadee hopping by and making a great
to-do, chattering and scolding as he came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Tommy Chickadee,&#8221; said Old
Man Rabbit.</p>

<p>But Tommy Chickadee was too much put out
about something to remember his manners. He
just chirped and scolded, because he was cold and
he couldn&#8217;t find a single crumb or a berry or anything
at all to eat. Then he flew away, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
feathers puffed out with the cold until he looked
like a little round ball, and all the way he chattered
and scolded more and more.</p>

<p>Old Man Rabbit finished his turnip, eating every
single bit of it, even to the leaves. Then he went
in his house to poke the fire in his stove and to see
how the pudding was cooking. It was doing very
well indeed, bumping against the pot as it bubbled
and boiled, and smelling very fine indeed. Old
Man Rabbit looked around his house at the corn
and the carrots and the turnips and the apples and
the potatoes and then he had an idea. It was a
very funny idea indeed, different from any other
idea Old Man Rabbit had ever had before in all
his life. It made him scratch his head with his
left hind foot, and think and wonder, but it pleased
him, too; it was such a very funny idea.</p>

<p>First he took off his muffler and then he put on
his gingham apron. He took his best red table-cloth
from the drawer and put it on his table and
then he set the table with his gold banded china
dinner set. By the time he had done all this, the
pudding was boiled, so he lifted it, all sweet and
steaming, from the kettle and set it in the middle of
the table. Around the pudding, Old Man Rabbit
piled heaps and heaps of corn and carrots and turnips
and apples and potatoes, and then he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
down his dinner bell that was all rusty because Old
Man Rabbit had very seldom rung it before, and
he stood in his front door and he rang it very hard,
calling in a loud voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dinner&#8217;s ready! Come to dinner, Billy Chipmunk,
and Molly Mouse, and Tommy Chickadee!&#8221;</p>

<p>They all came, and they brought their friends
with them. Tommy Chickadee brought Rusty
Robin who had a broken wing and had not been
able to fly South for the winter. Billy Chipmunk
brought Chatter-Chee, a lame squirrel, whom he
had invited to share his hole for a few months, and
Molly Mouse brought a young gentleman Field
Mouse, who was very distinguished looking because
of his long whiskers. When they all tumbled into
Old Man Rabbit&#8217;s house and saw the table with
the pudding in the center they forgot their manners
and began eating as fast as they could, every one
of them.</p>

<p>It kept Old Man Rabbit very busy waiting on
them. He gave all the currants from the pudding
to Tommy Chickadee and Rusty Robin. He
selected juicy turnips for Molly Mouse and her
friend, and the largest apples for Billy Chipmunk.
Old Man Rabbit was so busy that he didn&#8217;t have
any time to eat a bite of dinner himself, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
didn&#8217;t mind that, not one single bit. It made him
feel so warm and full inside just to see the others
eating.</p>

<p>When the dinner was over and not one single
crumb was left on the table, Tommy Chickadee
hopped up on the back of his chair and chirped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers for Old Man Rabbit&#8217;s Thanksgiving
dinner!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah, Hurrah,&#8221; they all twittered and
chirped and chattered. And Old Man Rabbit was
so surprised that he didn&#8217;t get over it for a week.
You see he had really given a Thanksgiving dinner
without knowing that it really and truly was
Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Great Stone Face</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You had only to lift your eyes, and there it was
plainly to be seen, though miles away, with the sunshine
brightening all its features.</p>

<p>What was the Great Stone Face?</p>

<p>It seemed as if an enormous giant had sculptured
his own likeness on a mountain side. There
was the broad arch of the forehead, a hundred feet
in height; the nose, with its long bridge; and the
vast lips, which, if they could have spoken would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
have rolled in thunder from one end of the valley
to the other. True it was that if you came too
near, you lost the outline of the Face and could
see only a heap of ponderous rocks, but when you
retraced your steps, the wondrous features could
be seen again, and the people who lived below it
believed that their valley was so fertile because the
Great Stone Face looked down upon it lighting up
the clouds, and giving tenderness to the sunshine.</p>

<p>Now there was a little boy named Ernest who
lived in the valley, and his mother had told him a
story that her mother had told to her; a story so
very old that even the Indians did not know who
had first told it, unless it had been murmured by the
mountain streams, and whispered by the wind
among the tree tops. This was the story&mdash;that,
sometime, a child should be born who would become
the greatest and noblest person of his time,
and his face, in manhood, should be the exact likeness
of the Great Stone Face. But though the
people had watched and waited until they were
weary, no man greater and nobler than his neighbors
had they yet beheld.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, dear mother!&#8221; cried Ernest. &#8220;I
do hope I shall live to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may,&#8221; said his mother doubtfully.</p>

<p>And Ernest never forgot the story. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
always in his mind whenever he looked upon the
Great Stone Face. He grew up in the log cottage,
and was dutiful to his mother, and helped her with
his little hands and more with his loving heart.
From a lad he became a quiet youth, sunbrowned
from work in the fields, and well learned, though
he never had any teacher except that Great Stone
Face which smiled down upon him at night when
his work was done.</p>

<p>About this time there went a rumor through the
valley that the great man who was to bear a resemblance
to the Great Stone Face, had appeared
at last. His name was Gathergold, and he was a
very rich merchant and owned a whole fleet of
ships. All the countries of the world had added
to his wealth. The cold regions of the North had
sent him furs; hot Africa had gathered the ivory
tusks of her great elephants out of the forests; the
East had brought him spices and teas and diamonds
and pearls. Mr. Gathergold had become so very
rich that it would have taken him a hundred years
to count his money so he decided to go back and
end his days in the valley where he was born.</p>

<p>He ordered a wonderful palace of marble so
dazzlingly white that it seemed as if it would melt
in the sunshine. When the mansion was done, the
upholsterers came with magnificent furniture, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
then a whole troop of black and white servants who
said that Mr. Gathergold would arrive at sunset.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he comes,&#8221; cried the people who were
waiting to see him. &#8220;Here comes the great Mr.
Gathergold!&#8221;</p>

<p>A carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round
the turn of the road. Within it sat a little old
man with a skin as yellow as his own gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very image of the Great Stone Face!&#8221;
shouted the people, but Ernest, who had been
watching, too, turned sadly and looked up the
valley, where, in the gathering mist, he could see
the wonderful Face, and the lips seemed to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>The years went on, and Ernest was a young
man, still good, and true, and kind. Poor Mr.
Gathergold died and was buried, and the oddest
part of the matter was that his wealth all disappeared
before he died, leaving nothing of him but a
skeleton covered with a wrinkled yellow skin; and
every one decided that he had never borne the
slightest resemblance to the Great Stone Face.</p>

<p>Then a warworn veteran, who had won great
honors on the battlefield and was named Old
Blood-and-Thunder decided to come back to the
valley where he had been born. His neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
resolved to welcome him with a salute of cannon
and a public dinner, for they were all quite sure
Old Blood-and-Thunder would bear the likeness of
the Great Stone Face.</p>

<p>On the day of his arrival Ernest and all the
others left their work and went out to meet Old-Blood-and-Thunder.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the same face, to a hair!&#8221; cried one man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderfully like,&#8221; cried another.</p>

<p>Then Ernest saw him. There he was, over the
shoulders of the crowd with glittering epaulets and
an embroidered collar and there, too, through the
vista of the forest appeared the Great Stone Face.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not he,&#8221; thought Ernest.</p>

<p>More years passed. Ernest was now an older
man. He still laboured for his bread, but he had
done so much for his neighbors that it seemed as if
he had been talking with the angels and had gotten
a portion of their wisdom unawares.</p>

<p>The people of the Valley had found out&mdash;after
a while&mdash;that Old Blood-and-Thunder&#8217;s face had
not the gentleness of the Great Stone Face and now
they said, again, that its likeness was to appear
upon the broad shoulders of a great statesman.</p>

<p>Old Stony Phiz, he was called, and while his
friends were doing their best to make him President,
he set out on a visit to the valley where he
had been born.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Ernest and all the others went out to meet him.
A cavalcade came prancing along the road, with a
clattering of hoofs. There was a band of music,
and while the people were throwing up their hats
and shouting, an open barouche came by, drawn
by four black horses. Inside with his massive head
uncovered sat the great statesman, Old Stony Phiz,
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confess it,&#8221; cried some one to Ernest. &#8220;The
Great Stone Face has met its equal.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ernest turned away disappointed. The
eyes and brow of the great man had none of the
nobleness of the Face on the mountain side.</p>

<p>And Ernest grew to be an old man, but a strange
thing happened. He was no longer an obscure
husbandman. Men from the cities began coming
to see him to learn from him the things that he had
learned from the Great Stone Face, things not put
down in books, and he was suddenly become
famous.</p>

<p>One day a great Poet came to the Valley and
stopped at Ernest&#8217;s cottage to ask shelter for the
night.</p>

<p>It was Ernest&#8217;s custom each evening to talk to
the assemblage of neighbors in a small nook among
the hills near his cottage. To this spot he and the
Poet went at sunset. All about was the pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
foliage of many creeping plants, while Ernest&#8217;s
friends sat in the grove at his feet and in another
direction could be seen the Great Stone Face
with heavy mists about it, like the white leaves
around the brow of Ernest.</p>

<p>At that moment Ernest&#8217;s face, as he began to
speak, grew wonderfully grand, and the Poet
threw his arms aloft and shouted,</p>

<p>&#8220;Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness
of the Great Stone Face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then all the people looked and saw that what the
poet said was true. The prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

<small>TRAINING A CHILD&#8217;S MEMORY BY MEANS OF A
STORY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the first place, what is the mental process
by means of which we recall something
stored in the cedar and lavender of our
mind chests?</p>

<p>As you pass along a crowded city thoroughfare
you are suddenly and unexpectedly confronted
by an old friend. She steps out of a
crowd of strangers and faces you. You recognize
her at once as a bit of long-ago, changed
with the years a bit but still, in a measure, familiar.
You are unable though, for an instant&#8217;s
space, to recall your friend&#8217;s name. In
that instant&#8217;s pause, however, a mental miracle
takes place illuminating for us the process by
means of which the human mind brings about
a recall of an idea.</p>

<p>You clasp your friend&#8217;s hand. You look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
deep into her eyes. You note a similar perfume
permeating her clothing that you knew in
former years. She speaks to you, and you
recognize the old, familiar quality of tone in
her voice. Then the miracle happens, and
your friend&#8217;s name finds its way to your lips.
It is Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;. You had not really forgotten
Mrs. B&#8217;s name. It had been stored
away in a cobweb-hung corner of your mind
together with its mental associates; the <i>touch</i>
memories of her hand clasp, the <i>odor</i> memory
of her perfume, the <i>sound</i> memory of her
voice. As you again experience these touch,
odor and sound stimuli, Mrs. B&#8217;s name rises in
their wake like a ph&oelig;nix long buried in the
ashes of forgetfulness.</p>

<p><i>Memory is a process of association of ideas.
Not repetition of an idea, but surrounding it
with a host of witnesses gives it permanency in
the mind.</i></p>

<p>To a greater extent than can possibly be estimated
does this associative quality of memory
hold in the case of children. We wish to teach
a kindergarten child that a certain type of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
flower is known as a <i>rose</i>. We do not repeat to
him over and over again, or ask him to repeat
to us, in order to fix this fact in his mind&mdash;&#8220;<i>This
is a rose. This is a rose.</i>&#8221; Instead, we
ask him to smell of the flower, note its color,
the shape of its petals, its peculiar, thorny
stem, its leaves. We help the child to draw a
picture of a rose. We ask him to show us all
the roses he can find as we take him to walk
in the garden. Then, when the child has the
flower&#8217;s color, odor, feeling, form and garden
environment as a crowd of mind witnesses to
prove its individuality, we say &#8220;<i>This is a rose</i>,&#8221;
and the child is very apt to remember the
flower.</p>

<p>A well-constructed child&#8217;s story has the associative
quality that characterizes the mental
process of memorizing. It has one central
theme; an act of heroism, a nature fact, a bit of
natural history, a note of the fantastic or the
humorous and around this central theme are
grouped the story associates; the dialogue, the
description, the sensory elements, the surprise
of the climax, all of which fix indelibly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
mind this central theme around which the story
is written.</p>

<p><i>Every well told story means an added possibility
of a recall in the child&#8217;s mind and
strengthens the general process of memory.</i></p>

<p>Laura Richards&#8217; story of &#8220;The Pig Brother&#8221;
illustrates the type of story for which the story
teller should search in order to train a child&#8217;s
memory. The theme of the story, the idea that
is to be made a fixture in the child&#8217;s mind, is
that of the value of <i>cleanliness</i>, and <i>order</i> in
life. The treatment of the theme is constructive,
a process of building up scenes and blocking
out unessentials to strengthen and make
permanent the theme in the child&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was once a child who was untidy,&#8221;
the story begins.</p>

<p>With no wasting of time over details the
child who hears the story is introduced to the
theme. There follows a bit of description explaining
the <i>kind</i> of untidiness of the little
story hero, how he left his toys and boots scattered
about his play-room, spilled ink and covered
his pinafore with jam. Then the child is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
confronted by the Tidy Angel who tells him
to go out in the garden and play with his
brother while she puts his nursery back into
its former state of orderliness. The child goes
out to the garden but he is in a condition of
wonder in regard to this brother whom he is
to seek. He meets a squirrel in the garden
path, and he asks it if it is his brother, but the
squirrel denies all relationship to the child because
of his untidiness. Then the child meets
a wren, and asks it the same question, which
the bird also indignantly denies because of the
child&#8217;s untidy appearance. The child then interrogates
the Tommy Cat who scorns all
thought of relationship to him, telling him to
go and look at himself in a mirror. The climax
of the story is found when the child meets
a pig who promptly claims relationship with
him and causes the child to go back to his play-room
resolved to be tidy and orderly in the
future.</p>

<p>The story has a memory value for children
because it presents one idea with a number of
related associates. The story theme of the unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
results of being untidy is never lost
sight of, but is presented over and over again
in a series of related scenes so differentiated,
however, by their contrast as to make them
permanent in the child&#8217;s mind. We may take
these different scenes in the order in which
the author presents them, discovering that
each forms a stone in the whole structure, differing
in their value but all taking form and
color from one theme.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Scene 1. The child hero is banished
from his play-room and his toys
as a result of his own acts.</p>

<p>Scene 2. The child finds that he
has no part in the outside world of
little wild creatures, also because of
his untidy habits.</p>

<p>Scene 3. For the same self-inflicted
reason, he is disowned by his
friends, the birds.</p>

<p>Scene 4. His house friend, the
cat, disowns him because his habits
of personal cleanliness do not accord
with her standards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Scene 5. The child finds the natural
consequence of his untidiness in
his welcome by the despised pig
which brings about his resolve to be
clean and orderly, hereafter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Each story scene, as shown in this analysis
is carefully planned, having in mind a grouping
of associated ideas that will strengthen and
vivify the image made on the child&#8217;s mind by
the story theme. As a result the child who
has heard the story of &#8220;The Pig Brother&#8221; has
gained a store of associated ideas that will be
recalled when some one asks him to pick up his
toys or use care in eating. He will remember
that squirrels and birds are orderly in their
nest making, that his cat uses care in regard to
her person, that there is a big, unseen force at
work in the world that makes for order&mdash;whether
one calls it an Angel, or not, it really
exists&mdash;and he remembers that a disregard of
this law of order means disaster to the law
breaker. The child of the story escaped from
the Pig. He may not be so fortunate if he
breaks the law. So our real child turns over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and examines and sorts and weighs his mental
associates of the concept <i>untidiness</i>, and makes
his own decision in the negative in a way that
would not have been possible without the carefully
associated scenes of the story.</p>

<p>This may seem an over fine analysis of one
story but it will help us in judging other child
stories having a regard to their memory value
for the child.</p>

<p>Almost, if not more important a consideration
than the writing of a drama, is the matter
of the stage &#8220;business&#8221; in its successful production.
The manager must decide which movements
of his actors, which exits and entrances,
which stage arrangement, lighting and what
scheme of costuming will strengthen the salient
idea underlying the plot of the drama and
make it a <i>memory</i> in the minds of the audience.
Stage &#8220;business&#8221; is a matter of psychology. It
means that the stage manager, the playwright
or whoever knows the audience best is going
to plan a mechanical background, a hedge, a
wall, of associates that will make the audience
remember the play. A good story should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have &#8220;business,&#8221; the necessary costuming and
lighting.</p>

<p>How shall the story teller apply this memory
test in her selection of stories? How shall she
be able to say with authority:</p>

<p>&#8220;My children will not forget this story!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the first place we should assure ourselves
to our complete satisfaction in selecting a story
that it <i>has a theme</i>, a <i>motif</i> upon which we can
build the chords of a complete melody. It is
doubtful if the story of &#8220;The Greedy Cat&#8221; has
a sufficient theme to make it of value as a memory
story, although it has a very real place in
the child&#8217;s life as a relaxing bit of nonsense.
&#8220;The Little Pine Tree That Wished New
Leaves&#8221; has a well defined theme&mdash;that of
<i>contentment</i>.</p>

<p>The second question that we will ask ourselves
will be, <i>is this story theme a worth while
one for us to give the children as a permanent
part of their mental lives?</i> We would hardly
wish a child to remember always about the
greed of the gormandizing cat. We would be
glad to have him hang up in his mind house a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
picture of content as illustrated by the little
green tree that discovered his own leaves to be
better than any others.</p>

<p>Last, we will ask, <i>is the story theme so compellingly
associated with other ideas that it
will become a memory for the child?</i> In the
case of the story of the Little Pine Tree, this
treatment is carefully adhered to. Never is
the <i>leaf</i> idea lost. Instead, the idea is presented
in the form of gold leaves, leaves of
glass, in fact all the strange and different leaves
for which the discontented tree wished. But
the gold leaves are stolen by a miser; the glass
leaves are broken in a storm, and its juicy large
leaves are all eaten by a goat. The climax is
reached when the little tree is glad to have
back its slender green needles; and the story is
fixed in a child&#8217;s mind because of its associative
treatment.</p>

<p>This memory training by means of story telling
is a legitimate &#8220;short cut&#8221; in teaching.
The nature fact, that difficult bit of geography,
that fine point of ethics may all be given a permanent
place in the child&#8217;s mind if we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
find just the right story to help in fixing them.
The list of stories that follows at the end of
this chapter was selected having in mind in
the case of each story, its associative treatment
of one theme worth while as a memory for the
child. Hans Andersen&#8217;s story of Little Tuk is
a brilliant example of using associated ideas
to set the memory gem of the plot.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Little Tuk</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there was little Tuk. As a matter of fact
his name was not Tuk at all, but before he could
speak properly he called himself Tuk. He meant
it for Carl, so it is just as well we should know
that. He had to look after his sister Gustave who
was much smaller than he was, and then he had his
lessons to do, but these two things were rather difficult
to manage at the same time.</p>

<p>The poor little boy sat with his little sister in
his lap, at the same time looking at his open geography
book which he held in front of him. Before
school time the next morning he had to know the
names of all the towns by heart and everything
there was to know about them.</p>

<p>At last his mother came home, for she had been
out, and she took little Gustave. Tuk ran to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
window and read as hard as he could, for it was
growing dark fast, and his mother could not afford
to buy candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the old washerwoman from the lane,&#8221;
his mother said as she looked out of the window.
&#8220;She can hardly carry herself, and yet she has
to carry the pail from the pump. Run down,
little Tuk, and be a dear boy. Help the old
woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tuk jumped up at once and ran to help her, but
when he got home again it was quite dark and it
was useless to talk about candles. He had to go to
bed. He had an old turn-up bed, and he lay in it,
thinking about his geography lesson, the Island of
Zealand, and all his teacher had told him about it.
He ought to have been learning the lesson, but of
course, he could not do that now. He put the
geography book under his pillow and he lay there
thinking, and thinking&mdash;and then all at once it
seemed just as if some one had kissed him on his
eyes and nose and mouth, and he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Yet he was not quite asleep either. It seemed
to him as if the old washerwoman were looking at
him with her kind eyes and saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a great shame if you were not to
know your lesson. You helped me, and now I will
help you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>And all at once the book under his head went
&#8220;cribble, crabble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cluck, cluck, cluck!&#8221; There stood a hen from
the town of Kiöge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a Kiöge hen,&#8221; it said, and then it went on
to tell him how many inhabitants there were, and
about the battle which had taken place there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cribble, crabble, bang!&#8221; something plumped
down; it was a wooden bird, the popinjay from
Præstö. It told him that there were just as many
inhabitants in Præstö as it had nails in its body, and
it was very proud of this.</p>

<p>Now little Tuk no longer lay in bed. Gallop-a-gallop
he went. He was sitting in front of a splendidly
dressed knight with a shining helmet and a
waving plume. They rode through the woods to
the old town of Vordingborg, a very large and
prosperous town. The castle towered above the
royal city, and lights shone through the windows.
There were songs and dancing within and the king
was leading out the stately young court ladies to the
dance. Morning came, and as the sun rose, the
town sank away and the king&#8217;s palace, one tower
after the other. At last only a single tower remained
on the hill where the castle had stood, and
the town had become tiny and very poor. The
schoolboys came along with their books under their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
arms, and they said, &#8220;two thousand inhabitants,&#8221;
but that was not true. There were not so many.</p>

<p>Little Tuk was still lying in his bed. First he
thought he was dreaming, and then he thought he
was not dreaming, but there was somebody close to
him.</p>

<p>It was a sailor, a tiny little fellow, who might
have been a cadet, and he said, &#8220;Little Tuk! Little
Tuk! I greet you warmly from Korsöer which
is a rising town. It is a flourishing town with
steamers and coaches. It lies close to the sea and
it has good high roads and pleasure gardens. It
wanted to send a ship round the world but it did
not do it, although it might have. And there is the
most delicious scent about the town because there
are beautiful rose gardens close by the gates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Tuk saw them, the green and red flowering
branches, and then they vanished before his
eyes and changed into wooded heights sloping
down to the clear waters of the fjord. A stately
old church towered over the fjord with its twin
spires. Springs of water rushed down in bubbling
streams, close by them sat an old king with a
golden crown round his flowing locks. It was
King Kroar of the Springs, and little Tuk was in
R&oelig;skilde. Down over the slopes and past the
springs walked hand in hand all Denmark&#8217;s kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and queens wearing their crowns. On and on they
went into the old church in time to the pealing of
the bells and the rippling of the springs.</p>

<p>All at once everything vanished&mdash;where were
they? Now an old peasant woman stood before
little Tuk. She was a weeding woman and came
from Sorö where the grass grows in the market
place. She had put her gray linen apron over her
head and shoulders. It was soaking wet; there
must have been rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, it has been raining,&#8221; she said.
Then she suddenly shrank up and wagged her
head. It looked as if she were about to take a
leap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Koax,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is wet; it is wet; it is dull
as ditch water&mdash;in good old Sorö.&#8221; She had become
a frog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Koax&#8221; and then once more she was the old
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;One must dress according to the weather,&#8221; said
she. &#8220;It is wet, it is wet. My town is like a
bottle; you get in by the neck and you have to come
out the same way again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman&#8217;s voice sounded just like the
croaking of frogs, or the creaking of fishing boots
when you walk in the swamp. It was always the
same sound, so tiresome, so tiresome that little Tuk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
fell into a deep sleep, which was the best thing for
him.</p>

<p>But even in this sound sleep he had a dream,
or something of the sort. His little sister, Gustave,
with the blue eyes and golden, curly hair, had
all at once become a lovely grown up girl and,
without having wings, she could fly. So Gustave
and Tuk flew together right across Zealand, over
the green woods and deep blue waters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear the cock crowing, little Tuk?
The hens come flying up from Kiöge town. You
shall have such a big, big chicken yard. You will
be a rich and happy man! Your house shall hold
up its head like the king&#8217;s towers, and be richly
built up with marble statues like those in Præstö.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name will spread round the world with
praise like the ship which was to have sailed from
Korsöer; and it will be known as far as R&oelig;skilde
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little Tuk seemed to hear all this in his dreams,
but he suddenly woke up. It was bright daylight,
and he sprang out of bed and read his book. He
found that he knew all the towns in his geography
book almost at once.</p>

<p>The old washerwoman put her head in at the
door, nodded to him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many thanks for your help of yesterday, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
dear child. May you have the wish of your
heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>But little Tuk hurried off to school with his book
under his arm. He knew that he had already
the wish of his heart&mdash;he had learned his geography
lesson.</p>

<small>THE INSTINCT STORY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A NEWLY hatched chicken begins its
daily work of living and providing for
itself by scratching the earth in a phenomenally
short space of time after it has chipped its
shell. A baby notices a kitten and stretches
out its hands to grasp in them a colored flower
at almost the same period of its development as
when it smiles at its mother. The chicken and
the baby are alike in being creatures of <i>instinct</i>.
The chicken scratches because its mother
scratched for a living in the days of her
chicken-hood and so did her mother and as
many other hens and chickens as many previous
years as one can count. The baby
feels himself akin with the cat and loves the
flower because his ancestors lived in close comradeship
with animals and nature. From
these and from an analysis of many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
phases of instinct we may come at a working
definition of the phenomenon.</p>

<p><i>Instinct may be defined as inherited memory.</i></p>

<p>It may be said that a child starts out on his
life journey with a certain amount of brain
capital which is his gift at birth. He has no
knowledge of the outside world at birth.
Color, sound, heat, cold and like concepts are
unknown to him and he must make them his
through the medium of his senses. The will
to use his senses in the acquiring of useful information
constitutes his brain capital, however.
Instinctively he claims brotherhood
with the animal world, and instinctively also
he claims kinship with trees and flowers and
winter and summer and birds and the gleaming
earth. Pebbles and shells and sand and
seeds interest him with a compellingness beyond
our understanding until we remember
that a child is the epitome of all the ages of
the race which have combined to make us and
our civilization. The age when man bartered
with pebbles, decorated his person with
shells, lived in a cave and found his food in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
seeds and berries is exemplified in the little
chap at play on the beach with these same nature
materials.</p>

<p>This mind capital of instinct with which the
child comes into the world may be divided
into the instinct to <i>express ideas in bodily
movements, instinctive interest in animals and
nature</i>, the <i>instinct</i> in <i>rhythm</i>, and the <i>instinct
for self-preservation</i> (less highly developed
in children than in animals.) There are
other and finer divisions into which the different
phases and manifestations of instinct
fall but for purposes of our discussion these
more elastic divisions will serve. The first division,
the motor instinct, involves so much in
the matter of a child&#8217;s dramatizing of stories
that it needs a chapter devoted wholly to a
study of a child&#8217;s bodily expression as stimulated
by the images which he has in his mind.
The instinct in rhythm, instinctive love of animals
and nature, the self-preservation and curiosity
instincts may be briefly considered in
order of their appearance in the child&#8217;s development,
having in mind their influence
upon the stories we select for a child&#8217;s hearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
A financier makes it his special study
to discover the best uses to which he can put
his capital in order to make it produce for
him appreciable dividends. The story teller,
using the child mind capital, <i>instinct</i>, as a
basis for her selection of stories will find that
there are certain <i>instinct</i> stories that she may
select for her use, each one of which gives back
good returns to her along the measure of
child interest.</p>

<p>Instinctive interest in rhythmic movements
and rhythmic sounds is found in the very
young child. He likes to be <i>trotted</i>, sung to
in a monotonous, sing-song fashion; he enjoys
clapping his hands in time to some nursery
jingle or ditty. Long after this rhythmic period
of babyhood is past children like to hear
stories that have the rhythmic, repetitional
quality, or some jingle introduced that stimulates
rhythm. Predominantly is this rhythmic
quality found in Mother Goose and folk lore.
Children, even of kindergarten age, take
the greatest delight in repeating and singing
over and over again such rhythmic ditties
as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<div class="verse">&#8220;Pitty, patty polt; shoe the wild colt.</div>
<div class="verse">Here a nail, there a nail, pitty, patty polt.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker&#8217;s man</div>
<div class="verse">Bake me a cake as fast as you can,</div>

<div class="verse">And one flew over the black-bird&#8217;s nest.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The appeal for the child in the case of all
such jingles is a <i>bodily</i>, <i>instinctive</i> one. <i>This
instinctive interest in rhythm is the beginning
of bodily expression. The repetition of sounds,
even though they are meaningless, makes the
child feel the story.</i> It gets into his muscles,
so to speak, if we may put a psychological fact
into physiological terms.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the old folk tales are characterized
by this rhythmic swinging-along mode
of construction. We all know how children
wait breathlessly, and then fairly bubble over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with ecstatic mirth as they listen to &#8220;The
Teeny Tiny Lady,&#8221; &#8220;The House that Jack
Built,&#8221; and &#8220;The Kid Who Would Not Go.&#8221;
They literally wait spellbound for such phrases
as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>Sheer nonsense, we say? Possibly, for the
ears of adults, but for a child it means instinct
food. This doggerel verse belongs to a certain
stage of his development just as folk songs
and war songs of quite as strange content have
come down to us from primitive races; and a
very sure way of securing a child&#8217;s involuntary
attention to a story is to select it having in
mind its rhythmic content.</p>

<p>Instinctive interest in animals and nature
follows the rhythm instinct. This should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
be construed into a statement that science and
biology should be given children in the story
form at an early age. Rather should the
world about the child be presented to him on
the plane of kinship, his one-ness with it. He
is the little Hiawatha, friend of the trees, the
deer, the birds, and the stars. Through this
friendly introduction to the world of Nature,
a child will come to know it, appreciate it,
and eventually understand it.</p>

<p>The animal and nature stories that make
the strongest appeal to the child&#8217;s primitive
nature instinct are those which, without mis-stating
scientific facts, still make nature of a
size with, friendly to, companionable with the
child.</p>

<p>King of animal story tellers was Joel Chandler
Harris. His &#8220;Nights With Uncle Remus&#8221;
is a book of <i>instinct</i>, <i>race</i> stories. Bre&#8217;r Rabbit
is an immortal <i>human</i> who walks side by
side with a child, holding familiar intercourse
with him and telling him the secrets of field
and wood and stream. Rudyard Kipling, in
the &#8220;Jungle Books&#8221; and the &#8220;Just So Stories&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
has met the <i>instinct</i> story needs of children by
making the wild creatures of the jungle and
desert vivid, human and companionable.
The fables of the Chinese, of Bidpai and of
Æsop have an instinctive interest for all children
because they are human documents, an
attempted explanation of the moral code, put
quaintly by primitive races into the mouths of
animals.</p>

<p>Nature stories that meet the <i>instinctive</i> interests
of children are less easy for the story
teller to find than are good animal stories.
The modern nature story that is written about
some dry scientific fact is only a bare husk
when a child is crying for real food. It would
be better to tell a child as a plain statement of
a universal fact that the cold mercifully kills
the plant that has served its use of reproduction
of species that it may make way for another
season&#8217;s cycle of buds and blooms, than
to tell a story about Jack Frost who, airily attired
in white, skips about the garden and puts
the flowers to sleep. Better, however, than
this former bald statement of the year&#8217;s autumnal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
death that presages the awakening to
new life in the spring is it to tell children the
story of &#8220;Ceres and Persephone.&#8221; Always,
afterward, will the bleak winter suggest to
their minds Persephone&#8217;s sojourn with Pluto
and spring will herald her return to her
mother, the flowers springing up for gladness
wherever she steps.</p>

<p><i>The myth meets every child&#8217;s instinctive interest.</i></p>

<p>It is a type of story that has been left us
by every race and people as the explanation
that primitive minds made of natural phenomenon.
Suppose a myth isn&#8217;t true. Was
the Jack Frost story true; and isn&#8217;t there more
real literature and imagery and inspiration in
the story of Persephone than in any modern
&#8220;Nature-faked&#8221; story? As a child stands on
Mount Olympus in company with the gods he
gets a vision of the universe that he would gain
in no other way. As he rides in Phaëton&#8217;s
chariot searching for the Apples of Hesperides
and helps old Atlas hold the world upon his
shoulders he is learning Nature as no text-book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
can teach her. As he listens to the murmuring
of the trees he hears the pipes of Pan and
the loving whispers of old Baucis and Philemon
among their branches.</p>

<p>We will feed the child&#8217;s instincts with the
old myths if we wish to secure his lasting interest
in nature.</p>

<p>A trifle more difficult for the story teller to
meet is the child&#8217;s instinct for self preservation.
In the case of the lower animals this
instinct manifests itself in a perpetual warfare
waged tooth and nail against its life enemies,
with a result epitomized, always, in the
survival of the stronger animal. Primitive
man waged a similar warfare. With a peaceful
civilization this condition of individual
warfare has been done away with, but the instinct
to fight for his rights, to preserve his <i>ego</i>,
to keep selfishly for his own certain <i>things</i> is
a part of the child&#8217;s mental heritage from his
forbears. The rhythm instinct, the <i>Nature</i> instinct
are the gold mine in child development.
The <i>self</i> instinct, while in a measure necessary
in fitting a child for the life struggle, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be, to a certain extent, inhibited. This inhibition
may be brought about through the medium
of stories.</p>

<p>Selecting just the right ethical stories to tell
a child having in mind making him unselfish
is a delicate matter. Each story should present
some problem in ethics that is likely to
come up in the child&#8217;s life. Moreover, the
moral of the story should be veiled but made
so obvious by the suspensive treatment and
climax of the story, that the child unconsciously
makes it his own and applies the
lesson to his own life. The moral of unselfishness
is rather the <i>result</i> of the story than
a part of it as the children make its obvious application
to their own lives.</p>

<p>The well-known folk tale of &#8220;The Little
Red Hen&#8221; teaches a lesson of unselfishness.
The selfish pig, cat and frog are deprived of
their portion of the freshly baked loaf of
bread because they had no share in its
making. Kipling&#8217;s story, &#8220;How the Camel
Got his Hump&#8221; in the &#8220;Just So Stories&#8221; has
the same moral of forgetfulness of self.
Laura E. Richards&#8217; story, &#8220;The Coming of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
King,&#8221; beautifully illustrates the type of story
that inhibits the selfish instinct. It draws a
wonderful word picture of the children&#8217;s garden
made ready for the King and finally welcoming
a beggar in ministering to whose
needs, however, the children find joy.</p>

<p>The most classic of <i>unselfish</i> stories in the
English language is Oscar Wilde&#8217;s &#8220;Selfish
Giant.&#8221; It needs no word of introduction or
explanation. It illuminates our dull subject
of endeavoring to make children self forgetful
through the stimulus of the ethical story.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Selfish Giant</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Every afternoon, as they were coming from
school, the children used to go and play in the
Giant&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>It was a large, lovely garden, with soft green
grass. Here and there over the grass stood beautiful
flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach
trees that in the springtime broke out into delicate
blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore
rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and sang so
sweetly that the children used to stop their games
in order to listen to them. &#8220;How happy we are
here!&#8221; they cried to each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>One day the Giant came back. He had been
to visit his friend, the Cornish ogre, and had stayed
with him for seven years. After the seven years
were over he had said all that he had to say, for his
conversation was limited, and he determined to
return to his own castle. When he arrived he
saw the children playing in the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221; he cried in a very
gruff voice, and the children ran away.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own garden is my own garden,&#8221; said the
Giant; &#8220;any one can understand that, and I will
allow nobody to play in it but myself.&#8221; So he
built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.</p>

<div class="bbox2">
<p class="center">
TRESPASSERS<br />
WILL BE<br />
PROSECUTED.</p></div>

<p>He was a very selfish giant.</p>

<p>The poor children had now nowhere to play.
They tried to play on the road, but the road was
very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did
not like it. They used to wander round the high
wall when their lessons were over, and talk about
the beautiful garden inside. &#8220;How happy we were
there,&#8221; they said to each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>Then the spring came, and all over the country
there were little blossoms and little birds. Only
in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.
The birds did not care to sing in it as there were
no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once
a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass,
but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry
for the children that it slipped back into the ground
again, and went off to sleep. The only people who
were pleased were the Snow and the Frost.
&#8220;Spring has forgotten this garden,&#8221; they cried, &#8220;so
we will live here all the year round.&#8221; The Snow
covered up the grass with her great white cloak,
and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then
they invited the North Wind to stay with them,
and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he
roared all day about the garden, and blew the
chimney-pots down. &#8220;This is a delightful
spot,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we must ask the Hail on a visit.&#8221;
So the Hail came. Every day for three hours he
rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke
most of the slates, and then he ran round and
round the garden as fast as he could go. He
was dressed in gray, and his breath was like
ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand why the spring is so late
in coming,&#8221; said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
window and looked out at his cold white garden;
&#8220;I hope there will be a change in the weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the spring never came, nor the summer.
The autumn gave golden fruit to every garden,
but to the Giant&#8217;s garden none. &#8220;He is too selfish,&#8221;
she said. So it was always winter there, and
the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and
the Snow danced about through the trees.</p>

<p>One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed
when he heard some lovely music. It sounded so
sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the
King&#8217;s musicians passing by. It was really only a
little linnet singing outside his window but it was
so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden
that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful
music in the world. Then the Hail stopped
dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased
roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him
through the open casement. &#8220;I believe the spring
has come at last,&#8221; said the Giant; and he jumped
out of bed and looked out.</p>

<p>What did he see?</p>

<p>He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a
little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and
they were sitting in the branches of the trees. In
every tree that he could see there was a little child.
And the trees were so glad to have the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
back again that they had covered themselves with
blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above
the children&#8217;s heads. The birds were flying about
and twittering with delight, and the flowers were
looking up through the green grass and laughing.
It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still
winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden,
and in it was standing a little boy. He was so small
that he could not reach up to the branches of the
tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.
The poor tree was still quite covered with
frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing
and roaring above it. &#8220;Climb up! little boy,&#8221; said
the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as
it could; but the boy was too tiny.</p>

<p>And the Giant&#8217;s heart melted as he looked out.
&#8220;How selfish I have been!&#8221; he said; &#8220;now I know
why the spring would not come here. I will put
that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and
then I will knock down the wall, and my garden
shall be the children&#8217;s playground for ever and
ever.&#8221; He was really very sorry for what he had
done.</p>

<p>So he crept downstairs and opened the front door
quite softly, and went out into the garden. But
when the children saw him they were so frightened
that they all ran away, and the garden became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for
his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see
the Giant coming. And the Giant strode up behind
him and took him gently in his hand, and put
him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once
into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it,
and the little boy stretched out his two arms and
flung them around the Giant&#8217;s neck, and kissed
him. And the other children, when they saw that
the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running
back, and with them came the spring. &#8220;It is
your garden now, little children,&#8221; said the Giant,
and he took a great axe and knocked down the
wall. And when the people were going to market
at twelve o&#8217;clock they found the Giant playing with
the children in the most beautiful garden they had
ever seen.</p>

<p>All day long they played, and in the evening
they came to the Giant to bid him good-by.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is your little companion?&#8221; he said:
&#8220;the boy I put into the tree.&#8221; The Giant loved
him the best because he had kissed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the children; &#8220;he
has gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must tell him to be sure and come here
to-morrow,&#8221; said the Giant. But the children said
that they did not know where he lived, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
never seen him before; and the Giant felt very
sad.</p>

<p>Every afternoon, when school was over, the children
came and played with the Giant. But the
little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen
again. The giant was very kind to all the children,
yet he longed for his first little friend, and often
spoke of him. &#8220;How I would like to see him!&#8221; he
used to say.</p>

<p>Years went over, and the Giant grew very old
and feeble. He could not play about any more,
so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children
at their games, and admired his garden. &#8220;I
have many beautiful flowers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the
children are the most beautiful flowers of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>One winter morning he looked out of his window
as he was dressing. He did not hate the winter
now, for he knew that it was merely the spring
asleep, and that the flowers were resting.</p>

<p>Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and
looked and looked. It certainly was a marvellous
sight. In the farthest corner of the garden was a
tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its
branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung
down from them, and underneath it stood the little
boy he had loved.</p>

<p>Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
into the garden. He hastened across the grass,
and came near to the child. And when he came
quite close his face grew red with anger, and he
said, &#8220;Who hath dared to wound thee?&#8221; For on
the palms of the child&#8217;s hands were the prints of
two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the
little feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who hath dared to wound thee?&#8221; cried the Giant;
&#8220;tell me, that I may take my big sword and
slay him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay!&#8221; answered the child; &#8220;but these are the
wounds of Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who art thou?&#8221; said the Giant, and a strange
awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.</p>

<p>And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to
him, &#8220;You let me play once in your garden, to-day
you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when the children ran in that afternoon,
they found the Giant lying dead under the tree,
all covered with white blossoms.</p>

<small>THE DRAMATIC STORY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the previous chapter we analyzed certain
primitive phases of mental life as
manifested in the instinctive acts of children.
These manifestations of instinct form a basis
for our story selection, guiding us toward a
final and certain goal of child interest.</p>

<p>One phase of instinct was left out of our
discussion except as it was touched upon primarily
in the analysis of a child&#8217;s instinctive
interest in rhythm. This is the instinct to express
through bodily movements the ideas that
have found a permanent place for themselves
in the mind.</p>

<p>Little E, three years old, was told by her
nurse the folk tale of &#8220;The Old Woman and
Her Pig.&#8221; She had heard very few stories,
and this one seemed to delight her beyond
words. She laughed and clapped her hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
over it, and begged to have it repeated and retold
even a third time. She made no comment
upon the text of the story, however. A week
later, she was left alone in her nursery for a
short period during the morning and her
mother, busy with household duties upon the
floor below, thought that she heard E&#8217;s voice.
Going, quietly, to the door of the nursery she
saw E standing, dramatically, in the center of
the room, holding a toy broom under her arm,
and shaking her finger at a small china pig
that stood on the floor in front of her. As
she did this, she said in the exact words of the
story that had been told her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Piggy won&#8217;t get over the stile, and I shall
not get home to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, E?&#8221; her mother asked
in some surprise.</p>

<p>E looked up in wonder as if she, herself,
knew a reason for her actions but one that
needed no explanation. Finally she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>doing</i> a story, mother,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>This incident of E&#8217;s instinctive and almost
unconscious dramatization of a story which
she had heard and whose images had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
fixed in her mind illustrates a very common
characteristic of a child&#8217;s mental life, the instinctive
impulse to vitalize the mental life by
putting it into terms of <i>expression</i>. It is true
that instinctive expression as commonly defined
includes in its first manifestations only
certain <i>unlearned</i> motor responses, those
forms of expression that are ours without previous
training or experience. A child cries
at a pain, laughs when he is tickled, starts
in fear at a sudden and loud noise. These
are the primitive forms of instinctive expression,
but beyond these and through the use of
certain child stories that are full of action,
compelling dialogue, and quick movement
comes a development of the dramatic instinct
in childhood of wonderful value to the
teacher.</p>

<p>Why do we want to make use of the dramatic
instinct in childhood?</p>

<p>First, because this instinct to <i>do</i>, to <i>act</i>, to
<i>express</i> is so common a part of each child&#8217;s
mental content upon entering school that it
forms part of our previously discussed child
brain capital. The instinct to <i>do</i> a story, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
give it expression in terms of bodily movement
would not be given a child unless it had
some value for the educator.</p>

<p>Second, we want to utilize the dramatic instinct
of childhood, because it is a very sure
way of helping a child to gain <i>poise</i>, <i>self-control</i>,
and a complete <i>mastery of his environment</i>.
The ability to give adequate expression
through speech or action to the mental
life characterizes the well-developed individual
as opposed to the victim of self-consciousness.
It means grace of body and freedom of
verbal expression.</p>

<p>What qualities differentiate the dramatic
child story from that story which is not as
well adaptable for child acting?</p>

<p>Primarily, the story that we select for purposes
of dramatization should have the quality
of being <i>visual</i>&mdash;that is, it should be so full of
simple, pictorial scenes, episodes and events
that it will bring to the minds of the children
a definite sequence of word pictures, stimulative
to action. This &#8220;moving picture&#8221; quality
is found in the old folk tales, the fables of
Æsop and La Fontaine. Here the stage setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of the stories is simple and easily pictured
by the child listeners. The story events
find an immediate and permanent place in the
child&#8217;s mind and a possible outlet in action
because of their apperceptive quality.</p>

<p>The story of &#8220;The Little Red Hen&#8221; is an
interesting type of the story that lends itself
to child dramatizing because of its <i>visual</i>
quality. There is a series of home scenes;
the little Red Hen&#8217;s garden, her house, her
kitchen, all familiar and easily seen by children
but illuminated with the interest of mystery
because of the Hen, herself, and her
friends, the Cat and the Frog. &#8220;The Elves
and the Shoemaker&#8221; is also a good story for
child acting, while among the most dramatic
visual fables are &#8220;The Town Mouse and The
Country Mouse,&#8221; &#8220;The Lion and the Mouse,&#8221;
&#8220;The Lark and Her Young Ones&#8221; and &#8220;The
Hare and the Tortoise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second quality that the story teller
should have in mind in selecting stories for
child dramatizing is <i>simplicity</i> of dialogue.
The story actors should converse, if not in
childlike manner, at least in a simple, easy-to-understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
vocabulary that will add to a
child&#8217;s store of words but will not tax him too
much in reproduction. Here, again, we must
turn to folk tales and fables for simple,
straightforward, rich dialogue. Quite naturally
and without apparent effort children
verbalize the dialogue of &#8220;The Little Red
Hen&#8221; after hearing the story once or twice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#8220;Who will build my fire?&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8220;Not I!&#8221; said the Frog.<br />
&#8220;Not I!&#8221; said the Cat.<br />
&#8220;Then I will,&#8221; said the Little Red Hen.</p></blockquote>

<p>These and the other bits of simple dialogue
that go to make up the plot of this story;
the conversation between the Wolf and the
Pig in the story of &#8220;The Three Little Pigs,&#8221;
the Lark and her little ones, Jack and the different
characters in the Beanstalk story, the
&#8220;Lion and the Mouse&#8221;&mdash;these are all examples
of easily reproduced dialogue, stimulating
spontaneous dialogue on the part of the
children.</p>

<p>One further consideration in connection
with the dramatic story&mdash;<i>spontaneity</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Because of the popularity of so-called story
dramatization among kindergartners and primary
teachers, a school of child acting in kindergartens
and the grades has sprung into life.
Stories are dramatized <i>for</i> children rather
than <i>by</i> the children themselves, and the results
obtained through unnecessary costuming,
certain stage properties and memorized dialogue
are of no appreciable value in the mental
development of the child. A child impersonates
a pig gifted with human attributes,
spontaneously, but he plays the part of a
dressed-up fairy in a wooden, unspontaneous
fashion. The difference between the two is
just the difference between instinctive expression
and prescribed action. In his &#8220;Principles
of Psychology,&#8221; Professor Thorndyke
says:</p>

<p>&#8220;Given any mental state, that movement
will be made which the inborn constitution of
the nervous system has connected with the
mental state or part of it. The baby reaches
for a bright object because, by inner organization,
that sense presentation is connected with
that act. For the same reason he puts an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
into his mouth when he feels it within his
grasp. The boy puts up his arm and wards
off a blow because his brain is so organized as
to connect those responses with those situations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Given any mental state, that movement
will be made which has been connected with it
or part of it most frequently, most recently, in
the most vivid experience and with the most
satisfying results.&#8221;</p>

<p>This careful and concrete statement of the
law governing instinctive movement gives us
our cue for selecting stories for child dramatizing
and our method in presenting them,
having in view&mdash;not child <i>acting</i>, but spontaneous
child <i>action</i>. We will provide no
costumes for our children, set no stage, but
only give them that story which will suggest
to them a recent, frequently repeated, vivid
experience with its accompanying satisfying
results in certain spontaneous movements.</p>

<p>Suppose we illustrate with a possible, voluntary
dramatizing of the old and well loved
folk tale of &#8220;The Gingerbread Boy.&#8221; The
experiences suggested to children by this story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and suggesting action to them are <i>the chase</i>
and the sense stimulus of <i>food</i>. After hearing
the story a number of times until they are
quite familiar with its dialogue and its characters
and its sequence of episodes, the teacher
may suggest to the children that they <i>play</i> it.
A disastrous way to begin the play would be
to assign the different characters in the story
to different children, showing them where to
stand or asking them to try and use the exact
words that the story characters did. Rather
should the dramatizing of the story be a developing
process on the part of the teacher.
If she has made the story permanent in the
minds of the children, their rendering of it
in action will be free and their dialogue spontaneous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who wants to be the Gingerbread Boy?</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would like to be the Gingerbread
Boy&#8217;s mother?</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a child with very bright, sharp eyes.
Is he not the Fox?</p>

<p>&#8220;We will need many Mowers and some
Threshers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the Pig, and who the Cow?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>These or similar hints on the part of the
teacher are cues for the opening of the play&mdash;all
that is needed, usually, to start the spontaneous
dramatization. As naturally as if
she were the story character herself, the little
old woman mother rolls and pats the Gingerbread
Boy into shape, puts him in an imaginary
oven and then falls asleep. He makes
his escape, is interviewed in turn by the
Threshers, the Mowers, the Pig and the Cow,
makes his escape from them also, only to be
eventually captured and eaten by the Fox.
As the story play goes on, it will be discovered
that the child actors are rendering with perfect
diction the dialogue of the story, enriching
their vocabulary and gaining power of
verbal expression. It will be discovered also
that their movements are illustrative of the
story, and absolutely lacking in self consciousness,
typical of an added quota of poise and
self-control gained through the play. Certain
<i>responses</i> are always made to certain
mind <i>situations</i>. What need is there of stage
setting since a child actor sees in his mind&#8217;s
eye the barn full of Mowers whose mouths are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
watering to eat him up? Why should the
tired-out teacher spend long after-school
hours sewing together costumes when, at an
instant&#8217;s notice, a child is able to clothe himself
in the sleek red coat and valiant brush of a
fox?</p>

<p>It is to be questioned if the books of so-called
dramatic stories for children which
may be obtained now are really educational
or have for their place upon the teacher&#8217;s desk
a firm psychologic background. Most of
them seem to have for their scheme of compiling
child <i>acting</i>, not <i>action</i>. The child on
the stage is not developing mentally. Rather
is he a mentally starved puppet, moved about
by the wires of the stage and repeating lines
in parrot-like fashion. The little girl, E,
quoted at the beginning is an example of mental
growth through spontaneous action. So
the books of dramatic stories seem to have
been prepared having in mind what the child
should <i>say</i> or <i>do</i>, rather than presenting such
interesting story material in such interesting
form that a child will <i>speak</i> and <i>do</i> without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
any further stimulus than that of the story
itself.</p>

<p>In selecting our stories for child dramatizing
we will go to original sources and choose
only such stories as are so rich in homely,
apperceptive incidents, and so marked by possibilities
for simple, interpretive dialogue as
to lend themselves to instinctive action on the
part of the children.</p>

<div class="verse">That&#8217;s what a little boy&#8217;s made of!</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well-a-day, but I wish I had a little boy for
all that! Some one to run to the store, and bring
in the kindlings, and drive the cows to pasture, and
feed the pig, and get into mischief, and be rocked
to sleep in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>She calls to the Little Old Man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! Oh, I say, Father! Fetch me the
jug of molasses from the pantry. I am making a
gingerbread cake for your supper!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Man does not move, or stir.</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman calls louder: &#8220;Fetch me
the molasses jug, Father!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman crosses to the chimney
corner, and shakes the Little Old Man, but he is
asleep and does not wake.</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman holds up her hands in
despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearie me! I might as well have a broom
for a Goodman as he. There is nothing done in
the house unless I attend to it myself,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>She leaves the kitchen for a moment, returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with the jug of molasses. She pours some molasses
into the bowl, stirs again, and finally empties
the dough out upon the board, rolling it flat with
her rolling pin. Suddenly she stops, rolling pin in
air.</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman: &#8220;I have it! I will
make me a Gingerbread Boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>She works very fast, talking as she shapes the
Gingerbread Boy with her fingers.</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman: &#8220;Here is his dear little
head, with currants for eyes, and one raisin for
his nose, and three raisins for his mouth. Here is
his fine little jacket with a row of currants for buttons;
and here are his two fine, fat little legs.
Here are his arms, and here are his shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lays the completed Gingerbread Boy in the
baking pan and dances about the kitchen with it in
her hands, singing as she dances, the Song of the
Gingerbread Man:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>As she finishes her song, she opens the imaginary
oven door, and, kneeling down, puts in the tin
which holds the Gingerbread Boy. Then she
shakes the Little Old Man again.</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman: &#8220;Wake up, I say, Father!
<i>Wake up!</i> <i>Wake up!</i> The garden&#8217;s to
be weeded, and the butter&#8217;s to be churned! Wake
up, I say, and mind the oven. There&#8217;s a fine little
Gingerbread Boy baking inside!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Man wakes very slowly, and
looking all about the kitchen says in a dazed sort
of way: &#8220;What&#8217;s that you say, Mother? I don&#8217;t
see any little Gingerbread Boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman goes to the stove and
points to the oven. &#8220;He&#8217;s in here baking. Do
you mind him while I&#8217;m away. In twenty minutes
by the clock, do you open the oven door, and the
Gingerbread Boy will be baked.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Man: &#8220;Yes, yes, Mother.
Do you go and weed the garden and churn. I&#8217;ll
sit here, and mind the oven.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Woman leaves the kitchen.
After she has gone, the Little Old Man re-lights
his pipe. Then he gets up from his chair and
peeps in the oven door.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man: &#8220;A fine, fat Boy! A
very fine, fat Gingerbread Boy! How his buttons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
shine, and he is swelling so much that his jacket is
splitting. I shall eat him for my supper!&#8221;</p>

<p>He goes back to his chair, and begins smoking,
but soon his head nods. He looks up at the clock.</p>

<p>The Little Old Man: &#8220;In twenty minutes I
will take him out. I think I shall have a short nap
in the meantime.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Little Old Man falls fast asleep again, his
pipe falling to the floor. As he sleeps, the oven
door opens a little as if some one had pushed it
from the inside. The real Gingerbread Boy peeps
out through the crack. When he sees that the
Little Old Man is asleep, he steps out. He begins
blowing on his fingers and he puts them in his
mouth as if they were burned. He fans himself
with the baking tin which he brings with him out
of the oven, and he hops about the kitchen on the
tips of his toes.</p>

<p>The Gingerbread Boy: &#8220;My, but that oven
was warm! I might have been burned to a crisp
before any one remembered to take me out. So
this is my new home!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looks about in all the corners of the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>this</i> is my new father!&#8221;</p>

<p>He goes over to the Little Old Man, and pulls
his wig. Then he sits down, cross-legged on the
hearth, and goes on talking to himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>The Gingerbread Boy: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether
I want to live in this house or not. I know what
little boys have to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He counts on his fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;They have to run to the store, and bring in kindlings,
and drive the cows and feed the pigs. I&#8217;d
rather have a good time. I think I will run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He jumps up, and looks around the room, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody here to see me go. Hurrah!
Hurrah! Here I go, off by myself to see the
world!&#8221;</p>

<p>He runs lightly out of the kitchen.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Act II</span></p>

<p><i>Place</i>: A country road. The Gingerbread
Boy is discovered, sitting on top of the wall, talking
to himself.</p>

<p>The Gingerbread Boy: &#8220;Here I am, out by
myself, seeing the world. The world&#8217;s a very
pleasant place, only I do wish I were not made of
gingerbread, and I do wish that everybody wasn&#8217;t
so hungry. Wherever I travel some one wants to
eat me. Bless my buttons, there comes some one
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mowers come slowly along with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
scythes over their shoulders. They sing as they
walk:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;On Chopnose Day the Mowers rise,</div>
<div class="verse">As every one supposes,</div>
<div class="verse">And march upon the grass and flowers,</div>
<div class="verse">And cut off all their noses.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly the Mowers discover the Gingerbread
Boy.</p>

<p>First Mower: &#8220;Who sits there on top of the
wall?&#8221;</p>

<p>Second Mower: &#8220;It is a little boy made of gingerbread.&#8221;</p>

<p>First Mower: &#8220;Let us eat him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Second Mower, going up to the Gingerbread
Boy: &#8220;Good morning, my lad, where do you come
from, and where are you going this fine morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gingerbread Boy hops down from the wall,
and dances away on the tips of his toes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;I&#8217;ve run away from a Little Old Woman,</div>

<div class="verse">You can&#8217;t catch me,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;m the Gingerbread Man!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He disappears, followed by the Mowers, but
reappears at the other end of the road, looking
frightened and out of breath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>The Gingerbread Boy: &#8220;They didn&#8217;t catch
me that time, but you never can tell what&#8217;s
going to happen next. There comes somebody
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Threshers are seen passing with their flails
over their backs.</p>

<p>One of the Threshers: &#8220;Who is that by the
side of the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>A Second Thresher: &#8220;That is a Gingerbread
Boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both of the Threshers, going up to the Gingerbread
Boy very fiercely: &#8220;Come with us and be
eaten, my lad!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gingerbread Boy dances a little way ahead
of the Threshers as he calls back to them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">I&#8217;m the Gingerbread Man.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>He runs away a second time, followed by the
Threshers, but he is seen in a moment at the end
of the road. He climbs up on the wall again.</p>

<p>The Gingerbread Boy: &#8220;I wonder who will
try and eat me next!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>He puts his hand up to his eyes. &#8220;There comes
some one now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pig enters, grunting.</p>

<p>The Pig:</p>

What do I see? A Gingerbread Boy!&#8221; He
walks up to the wall, and stands on his back feet,

<p>The Gingerbread Boy: &#8220;Well, he didn&#8217;t get
me. I believe I am able to take care of myself
after all. Why, who is that great creature, coming
down the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fox enters. He sees the Gingerbread Boy,
but he pretends that he does not. He sits down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

<p class="center">THE FIRST PART OF THE STORY</p>

<p><i>Place</i>: A mouse hole in a barn.</p>

<p><i>Time</i>: The early evening of a day in the fall.</p>

<p>The Father, Mother, and younger mice are seen,
sitting about, and nibbling bits of candles, turnips,
carrots, and other dainties.</p>

<p><i>The Father</i>, taking a large bite of turnip, and
speaking between mouthfuls:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been a mile to the south and a mile
back to-day without meeting an enemy. I found
a field of corn, and a garden of turnips, and
a patch of large, juicy cabbages. For a
comfortable, fat old age, there is no place like
the country.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Mother</i>, running about very nimbly, and
gathering up all the candle ends:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Father. The farmer&#8217;s wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
cleaned the candlesticks to-day, and she threw
away all these ends. This evening I shall make a
large tallow pudding!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>One of the younger Mice</i>, who jumps up, and
begins dancing very gracefully about the mouse
hole on the tips of her toes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody goes to bed so very, very early in
the country. A mouse may dance until morning
without being caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she dances, the other Mice drop whatever
they were eating, and they sing in funny, squeaking
voices, a tune to which her feet keep time.</p>

<p>This is their song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Squeak, squeak, skip, skip!</div>
<div class="verse">Gather your tail up, and trip, trip!</div>
<div class="verse">Crickets and grasshoppers dance by day,</div>
<div class="verse">But night is the time for a mouse to play,</div>
<div class="verse">When the moon shines round, like a great big cheese&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">When only the sleepy Sand Man sees&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Then&mdash;Squeak, squeak, skip, skip!</div>
<div class="verse">Gather your tails up, and trip, trip!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>When the Mice finish their song, the Father
looks all about the hole. Then he speaks.</p>

<p><i>The Father</i>: &#8220;I do not see your brother.
Where is your brother?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Mother</i>, peering about in all the dark corners
of the mouse hole: &#8220;Where is my son? Oh,
where is my son?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><i>All the younger Mice</i>, speaking together: &#8220;Oh,
where is our brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the younger Mice speak, the Country Mouse
enters at the back of the mouse hole. He wears
a large red necktie which has green spots, and is
tied in a bow in front. He seems to be very much
excited. All the Mice crowd about him.</p>

<p><i>The Father</i>, taking the Country Mouse by his
paw and leading him to the front of the mouse
hole:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been all day, my son?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Mother</i>, re-tying the Country Mouse&#8217;s necktie:
&#8220;You seem out of breath, my dear!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>All the younger Mice</i>, excitedly: &#8220;Where
have you been? Oh, do tell us where you have
been?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;I have had an adventure.
I started out early this morning for the
dairy, because I heard some one say that there
were cheeses being made. On the way to the dairy
I met a very fine Mouse, passing by on his way to
town. He lives in the town, and he told me all
about his home.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>All the younger Mice</i>, crowding closer that they
may hear what the Country Mouse is saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;What did the Town Mouse tell you about his
home?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;He said that he lived
in a pantry!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Father</i>: &#8220;A pantry?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Mother</i>: &#8220;A pantry?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>All the younger Mice</i>: &#8220;A pantry?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;Yes, a pantry! There
are pies there, and cakes. There are fat hams,
and juicy spare ribs. There are puddings, and
there are cheese rinds lying about on the shelves.
The servants are careless, and at night they leave
the food uncovered. Then the Town Mouse
comes out of the wall and sits on the pantry table,
and eats his fill.</p>

<p>&#8220;No cold gardens to be searched for food. No
frozen fields to be dug over for roots and corn
stalks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Country Mouse looks disdainfully about
the hole. Then he goes on speaking.</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;The Town Mouse invited
me to come and visit him this evening!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Younger Mice</i>: &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Father</i>, shaking his head, doubtfully:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, my boy. There is a wild animal who
lives in town houses. She has eyes as large as
saucers. She wears cushions on her feet that no
one may hear her when she walks. She has sharp
claws and sharper teeth. She can see in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><i>The Mother</i>: &#8220;It is the Cat! Don&#8217;t go to
town, my son. The Cat eats mice!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;I am not afraid of the
Cat. I am tired of this dull life in the country.
I want to see sights, and taste the good things
that are to be found in pantries. I am going, to-night,
to visit the Town Mouse!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Father, Mother, and all the younger Mice</i>
try to hold the Country Mouse, but he gets away
from them. He runs away through the back of
the mouse hole.</p>


<p class="center">THE SECOND PART OF THE STORY</p>

<p><i>Place</i>: A pantry.</p>

<p>The Town Mouse sits on the edge of the table,
eating, but nervously, and looking all about him as
he nibbles.</p>

<p>Under one of the shelves, and behind the Town
Mouse, so that he is not able to see her, sits the
Cat.</p>

<p><i>Time</i>: Midnight of the same evening.</p>

<p>The Cat plays that she is asleep, but she is really
watching the Town Mouse. Suddenly she
sneezes.</p>

<p><i>The Town Mouse</i>, dropping a large piece of
cheese, which he has been eating, and looking
around in a frightened way:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, my ears and whiskers! Is that a sneeze
which I hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He trembles and shakes violently. He sees no
one, though, so he picks up the cheese in one paw
and a slice of bread in the other. As he nibbles,
he talks to himself.</p>

<p><i>The Town Mouse</i>: &#8220;I am tired of this life in
town. Late suppers, and rich food to disturb one&#8217;s
digestion; traps, traps everywhere&mdash;wooden traps,
and wire traps, round traps, and square traps; traps
with doors, and traps with windows&mdash;and always a
Cat hiding in a corner. She may be in the room
now for all I know.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day I took a walk in the country and I met
a little farmer mouse in a red necktie. He thought
he would like to live in town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ough!&#8221; the Town Mouse shivers, &#8220;I wish I
were safe in the country, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a little noise at the back of the pantry,
and the Country Mouse enters in great glee, looking
about at all the food. The Cat sees the Country
Mouse, and she creeps, softly, a little farther
under the shelf, keeping watch of him all the
time.</p>

<p><i>The Town Mouse</i>, jumping down from the table,
and motioning with one paw for the Country
Mouse to make less noise:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, why did you come? It isn&#8217;t safe here.
You should have stayed in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>, paying no attention to the
Town Mouse, but running nimbly around the table
and tasting all the different things.</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;Cheese, and bread, and
cake, and pie&mdash;and jam!&#8221;</p>

<p>He puts his paw down in a jam pot, and eats a
little jam. Then he crosses to the Town Mouse
and pats him on his back.</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;A thousand thanks, my
fine fellow. This pantry of yours is a palace, and
you are the prince. No quiet, country life for me.
Here will we live and eat our fill&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stops suddenly, as the Cat once more sneezes.</p>

<p><i>The Town Mouse</i>, wringing his paws, and whispering
in great fright: &#8220;I heard it a moment or
so ago. I&#8217;ll wager I heard it; and now I hear it
again. Some one sneezed.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>, glancing about, but seeing
no one: &#8220;Who sneezed?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Town Mouse</i>: &#8220;The Cat.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>: &#8220;Where is the Cat?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Town Mouse</i>: &#8220;The Cat is everywhere.
She isn&#8217;t in the room, now, but she may be on her
way. Hours and hours she sits at the door of my
hole so I can&#8217;t come out in the evening. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
she chases me when I try to snatch a bite of supper,
and she follows me&mdash;follows, wherever I go.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The Country Mouse</i>, in a frightened voice:
&#8220;Are her eyes as large as saucers? Does she wear
cushions on her feet that no one may hear her
when she walks? Has she sharp claws, and
sharper teeth? Can she see in the dark? Does
she eat&mdash;mice?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Cat suddenly springs from her corner.
There is a great scamper, in which the mice make
their escape, but the Country Mouse leaves his long
tail in the Cat&#8217;s paws.</p>

<small>STORY TELLING AN AID TO VERBAL EXPRESSION</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">NEARLY all children find fluent speech
as readily as birds find song and
flowers find perfume. Occasionally, there is
a &#8220;different&#8221; child, though, who through shyness,
slow motor reaction or a retarded brain
development has difficulty in using words as a
medium of expressing himself.</p>

<p>There is always the problem, too, of the foreign-born
child. We find him a patient,
tongue-tied little scrap of humanity clad in
the garb of Italy or Russia or Germany clinging
to his mother&#8217;s skirts when the big vessel
docks and as dazed as she is at the babel of
strange speech that deafens, stuns him. Then
we see him in school and his linguistic problem
becomes more complicated. He is put
into a class where the ordinarily complex matters
of reading, writing, and ciphering are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
made increasingly more complex because they
are presented to him in a foreign language.
The school curriculum leaves small space in
the day for teaching a child to talk. Tony,
discouraged, baffled, puzzled, drifts farther
and farther into his great silence and is dubbed
a dunce, because he doesn&#8217;t know what his
teacher is talking about.</p>

<p>What shall we do with Tony who forms a
big unit in our ever increasing foreign population?
How shall we quickest help him
and every child to that ready expression
through speech that means power, efficiency,
self-control in later years?</p>

<p>There was my own, special Tony&mdash;a quaint
little man of five in yellow breeches, a green
shirt and a fur cap, which latter he persisted
in wearing during his entire school day for
fear that some one might steal it. Tony was,
&#8220;out of Naples.&#8221; His melting brown eyes
danced with delight at a bit of crimson paper,
a gold orange produced as a model for the
painting lesson, a red rose that meant a sense
game. But Tony&#8217;s warm, red lips remained
persistently closed. Days melted into weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and then were months and still Tony was
dumb. Ideas he had. Words he had not, although
I had tried daily to teach him to say,
<i>good morning</i>, <i>good-by</i>, <i>ball</i>, <i>clay</i>, <i>blocks</i> and
like words.</p>

<p>One day Tony electrified me, though. He
was always an attentive, close listener during
my story hour that ended the morning. Because
the children were, in the majority, foreign,
I selected short, repetitional stories for
telling. The children were fascinated with
the quaint old folk tale of &#8220;The Teeny Tiny
Lady.&#8221; As I told it, they had formed a habit
of joining me when I reached a familiar
phrase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the Teeny Tiny Lady,&#8221; they begged
again and as I finished the story, Tony&#8217;s eyes
danced, his lips parted&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once upon a time there was a lady, who
lived in a house in a village,&#8221; he began in
clear, pure English. With a little help he almost
retold the story. It was amazing, but
through the inspiration of the other children&#8217;s
enthusiastic story interest, the many repetitions
of the story and its simple, cumulative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
structure Tony had learned nearly a hundred
words. He talked after that, and he told us
stories. The story had unloosed his tongue.</p>

<p><i>Stories help children to verbal expression.</i></p>

<p>In the case of a foreign child who must be
taught English, or the American-born child
who is shy and so lacking in the power of expressing
himself through words, we will use
the old folk tale that repeats its words and
phrasing with happy familiarity and so
teaches speech.</p>

<p><i>It will not be necessary to make the child
or group of children feel that the story is being
used as a lesson in English.</i></p>

<p>Just select the <i>right story</i>.</p>

<p>Tell it <i>over and over again</i>, as long as the
children are interested in it&mdash;and you will find
that their interest will exhaust yours.</p>

<p>And encourage the children to <i>tell the story
with you</i>.</p>

<p>This method spells success in using the story
to increase a child&#8217;s vocabulary.</p>

<p>Certain stories stimulate the child to repeat
certain jingles or phrases <i>with</i> the story teller.
This explains their popularity and adds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
their value. The good old cumulative story
of the &#8220;Cat and the Mouse&#8221; is built around a
nonsense ditty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;First she leaped, and then she ran,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8217;Till she came to the cow and thus began.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>After a child learns and repeats this verse
he begins to add to it the sentences of the story
that precede and follow it. When the foreign
child is able to tell the last paragraph of
the story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;So the good baker gave the mouse some bread;
the mouse gave the bread to the butcher who
gave him some meat; the mouse gave the meat
to the farmer who gave him an armful of hay;
the mouse gave the hay to the cow and the cow
gave the mouse a saucer of milk for the cat.
Then the cat drank the milk and gave the mouse
his little long tail. And they went on playing in
the malt house.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;he has acquired a good working vocabulary
of English.</p>

<p>So there are a score of similar repetitional
stories that help a child to learn ready speech.
The Greedy Cat repeats the tale of his
prowess:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I have eaten my friend the mouse. I have
eaten an old woman, and a man and a donkey,
and the King and all his elephants. What is to
hinder my eating you, too?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Chicken Little bewails to every one she
meets:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The sky is falling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And in answer to the query &#8220;How do you
know?&#8221; she assures her questioner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I saw it with my eyes, I heard it with my ears,
and a bit of it fell upon my tail.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In Maud Lindsay&#8217;s story of &#8220;The Little
Gray Pony&#8221; there is a delightfully interpolated
jingle that repeats itself and adds to
itself in such fascinating fashion that children
cannot resist saying with the story teller:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Storekeeper! Storekeeper! I&#8217;ve come to you;</div>
<div class="verse">My little gray pony has lost his shoe!</div>
<div class="verse">And I want some coal the iron to heat,</div>
<div class="verse">That the blacksmith may shoe my pony&#8217;s feet.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>and its answer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Now, I have apples and candy to sell,</div>
<div class="verse">And more nice things than I can tell;</div>
<div class="verse">But I&#8217;ve no coal the iron to heat,</div>
<div class="verse">That the blacksmith may shoe your pony&#8217;s feet.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ever popular Little Half Chick with his
happy-go-lucky, daring journey to Madrid
compels children to tell his story as he
&#8220;<i>hoppity kicks</i>&#8221; through his adventures. The
Three Pigs with their three ever interesting
fates help a child to do his own story telling.
There is an exhaustless fund of folk lore to
draw upon that has few words in its story construction,
frequent and happy repetitions of
those words, and inspiration for a child to
make those words a part of his own vocabulary.</p>

<p>These bits of repeated phrasing in a story,
scraps of incorporated lyrics and jingles and
built-up cumulative paragraphs are like the
beads that help to make the child&#8217;s necklace.
On them he strings the thread of the story narrative,
making it so thoroughly a part of his
mental life that he is able to give it out again
in the remembered words of the story. Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
after the loved, &#8220;huffing and puffing&#8221; of the
wolf in the story of the &#8220;Three Little Pigs&#8221; has
become only a memory, a child uses the words,
<i>furze</i>, <i>blazing</i>, <i>scramble</i>, <i>fortune</i>&mdash;and a hundred
other words that came to him in this
happy story connection and so into his every-day
conversation.</p>

<p>The older child who has passed the nursery
tale and folk lore turnstile in his story road
finds help to a greater power in verbal expression
by means of the beautifully written story,
told in its original pure phrasing by the story
teller and enriching him because of its wonderful
English. A truly well-wrought story suffers
often at the hands of the story teller. It
isn&#8217;t necessary in telling such a story to bring it
down to the plane of the children&#8217;s intelligence;
rather we will bring the children up to
its heights of beautiful imagery and mellow
phrasing.</p>

<p>In telling Henry Ward Beecher&#8217;s story of
&#8220;The Anxious Leaf,&#8221; in &#8220;Norwood,&#8221; the story
should be memorized by the story teller. No
word of its vivid picturing should be lost. It
is a short story so this method of preparing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
for telling will not be irksome. A little girl
six years old who had been told this story several
times was out walking one fall with her
mother. She picked up a dead leaf, from the
ground, and holding it tenderly in her hand,
she repeated softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the little leaf began to <i>want</i> to go and
it grew very beautiful in thinking about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a little puff of wind came and tossed
it like a spark of fire in the air and it fell gently
down under the edge of the fence among hundreds
of other leaves; and it fell into a dream
and never waked up to tell what it dreamed
about&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This child&#8217;s vocabulary had been deeply enriched
by a story.</p>

<p>In Laura Richards&#8217; stories we find pure
English that will help children. In Rudyard
Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;Jungle Stories&#8221; and the &#8220;Just So
Stories&#8221; there is virile wording that every child
needs. Dean Hodges&#8217; &#8220;Bible Stories&#8221; preserve
for children the line phrasing of the Hebrews
as almost no other Bible story teller has
succeeded in doing. Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s
best translators have kept for us his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
matchless word painting. Such stories as
these teach a child purer use of English. Eugene
Field&#8217;s few child stories; &#8220;The Legend
of Claus,&#8221; &#8220;The Mouse and the Moonbeam,&#8221;
&#8220;The Maple Leaf and the Violet&#8221; sing in
their classic wording. No child can hear
them without having his vocabulary enriched.</p>

<p>It is quite possible to accomplish a great
deal through story telling, not only in teaching
English to the child who is foreign born
or dormant mentally, but in giving the average
child new and more colorful examples of word
painting than he has heard before.</p>

<p>The steps in story telling for verbal expression
in children are:</p>

<p><i>Selection.</i> The story must be worth while
telling from the point of view of its phrasing.
In the case of the child who really needs to be
taught to talk, short, rhymed or cumulative
tales are useful. With older children we will
select those beautiful examples of classic story
telling that should form part of a child&#8217;s mental
life and so help him to express himself in
pure diction.</p>

<p><i>Presentation.</i> These stories that are selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
by the story teller as being particularly
adapted to English teaching should be most
carefully prepared and presented happily,
compellingly, and in their exact, original
form with almost no variation in subsequent
telling so that they may present good models to
the children.</p>

<p><i>Repetition.</i> A story selected for its English
value should have frequent repetitions that
the children may become very familiar with
it and gain the power to repeat it themselves,
or at least learn certain parts of it, not as a
task but naturally, inspirationally.</p>


<p class="center"><small>STORIES THAT HELP A CHILD TO VERBAL EXPRESSION</small></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Woodpecker Who was Selfish</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There was once a little Lady Woodpecker&mdash;such
a trim, tidy little Lady Woodpecker&mdash;who
wore always a natty red bonnet, and a white apron
and who lived in a hole in a big Pine Tree. Her
house was cozy and comfortable, all lined with
moss and wool, and protected by a little brown
bark door so that it was cool in the summer time
and warm when the winter winds blew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>But the little Lady Woodpecker was a selfish
bird and she never, <i>never</i> asked any other birds to
come and visit with her in her house in the Pine
Tree.</p>

<p>In the next tree to the little Lady Woodpecker
lived a Fluffy Sparrow. His nest was loosely built
and untidy and it rested insecurely in a fork of a
tree so that the wind blew it this way and that way.
This was because all sparrows are poor nest builders
and it was not the Fluffy Sparrow&#8217;s fault at all.
One day there was an unusually heavy storm and
down from the tree blew the nest. So the Sparrow
had now no home.</p>

<p>Then the Fluffy Sparrow flew and hopped and
twittered beside the little brown bark door above
the little Lady Woodpecker and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Lady Woodpecker with the red bonnet,
have pity on me and take me into your house,
for the rain falls and I am very, very cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little Lady Woodpecker tapped with her
bill on the wall of her house and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you in to-day, Fluffy Sparrow. I
am cooking juniper berries for a batch of pies.
Come again some other time and perhaps I will let
you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Fluffy Sparrow hopped away and the rain
made him very, very cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>The next day the Fluffy Sparrow flew and
hopped and twittered again beside the little brown
bark door of the little Lady Woodpecker and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Lady Woodpecker with the red bonnet,
have pity on me and take me into your house,
for the cold and cruel wind blows and it ruffles my
feathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little Lady Woodpecker tapped again
with her bill on the wall of her house and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you in to-day, Fluffy Sparrow. I am
washing the pot in which I cooked a batch of juniper
berries for a batch of pies. Come again some
other time and perhaps I will let you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Fluffy Sparrow hopped away and the
cold and cruel wind ruffled his feathers.</p>

<p>The day after that the Fluffy Sparrow flew and
hopped and twittered again beside the little brown
bark door of the little Lady Woodpecker and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Lady Woodpecker, have pity on me
and take me into your house, for the biting frost
nips my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little Lady Woodpecker tapped again
with her bill on the wall of her house and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you in to-day, Fluffy Sparrow. I
am making the crust for my batch of juniper berry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
pies. Come again some other time and perhaps
I will let you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Fluffy Sparrow hopped away and the biting
frost nipped his feet.</p>

<p>But the fourth day the Fluffy Sparrow flew and
hopped and twittered once again beside the little
brown bark door of the little Lady Woodpecker
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Lady Woodpecker with the little red
bonnet, have pity on me and take me into your
house, for the snow blinds me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little Lady Woodpecker tapped <i>very</i>
hard with her bill on the wall of her house and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you in to-day, Fluffy Sparrow. I am
cleaning my floor before I sit down, all by myself,
to <i>eat</i> my juniper berry pies.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the blinding frost blinded the Fluffy Sparrow&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>Then the last day of all the Fluffy Sparrow flew
and hopped and twittered beside the little brown
bark door of the little Lady Woodpecker and he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, little Lady Woodpecker with the little red
bonnet, <i>please</i> have pity on me and take me into
your house, for I do not like the rain and the
wind and the frost and the snow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>But the little Lady Woodpecker did not answer
the Fluffy Sparrow. And the Fluffy Sparrow
lifted one claw and poked open the little bark door
and he saw that <i>no one was inside</i>. The little
Lady Woodpecker was away buying a key with
which to lock her door while she ate her batch of
juniper berry pies.</p>

<p>So the Fluffy Sparrow went inside the house in
the tree that was so cozy and comfortable because
it was lined with moss and wool. There he was
sheltered from the rain and the wind and the frost
and the snow. He ate up all the batch of juniper
berry pies.</p>

<p>When the little Lady Woodpecker came home
the Fluffy Sparrow was living in <i>her</i> house and she
had to find herself a new one because she had
been such a selfish bird.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Little Rabbit Who Wanted Red
Wings</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a little White Rabbit
with two beautiful long pink ears and two
bright red eyes and four soft little feet&mdash;<i>such</i>
a pretty little White Rabbit, but he wasn&#8217;t
happy.</p>

<p>Just think, this little White Rabbit wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
be somebody else instead of the nice little rabbit
that he was.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bushy Tail, the gray squirrel, went
by, the little White Rabbit would say to his
Mammy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mammy, I <i>wish</i> I had a long gray tail
like Mr. Bushy Tail&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Mr. Porcupine went by, the little
White Rabbit would say to his Mammy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mammy, I <i>wish</i> I had a back full of bristles
like Mr. Porcupine&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Miss Puddle-Duck went by in her
two little red rubbers, the little White Rabbit
would say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mammy, I <i>wish</i> I had a pair of red rubbers
like Miss Puddle-Duck&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went on and on wishing until his Mammy
was clean tired out with his wishing and Old Mr.
Ground Hog heard him one day.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Ground Hog is very wise indeed, so he
said to the little White Rabbit:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you-all go down to Wishing Pond,
and if you look in the water at yourself and turn
around three times in a circle, you-all will get your
wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little White Rabbit trotted off, all alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
by himself through the woods until he came to a
little pool of green water lying in a low tree stump,
and that was the Wishing Pond. There was a little,
<i>little</i> bird, all red, sitting on the edge of the
Wishing Pond to get a drink, and as soon as the
little White Rabbit saw him he began to wish
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish I had a pair of little red wings!&#8221;
he said. Just then he looked in the Wishing Pond
and he saw his little white face. Then he turned
around three times and something happened. He
began to have a queer feeling in his shoulders, like
he felt in his mouth when he was cutting his teeth.
It was his wings coming through. So he sat all
day in the woods by the Wishing Pond waiting for
them to grow, and, by and by, when it was almost
sundown, he started home to see his Mammy and
show her, because he had a beautiful pair of long,
trailing red wings.</p>

<p>But by the time he reached home it was getting
dark, and when he went in the hole at the foot of
a big tree where he lived, his Mammy didn&#8217;t know
him. No, she really and truly did not know him,
because, you see, she had never seen a rabbit with
red wings in all her life. And so the little White
Rabbit had to go out again, because his Mammy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
wouldn&#8217;t let him get into his own bed. He had
to go out and look for some place to sleep all
night.</p>

<p>He went and went until he came to Mr. Bushy
Tail&#8217;s house, and he rapped on the door and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, kind Mr. Bushy Tail, may I sleep in
your house all night?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr. Bushy Tail opened his door a crack and
then he slammed it tight shut again. You see he
had never seen a rabbit with red wings in all his
life.</p>

<p>So the little White Rabbit went and went until
he came to Miss Puddle-Duck&#8217;s nest down by the
marsh and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, kind Miss Puddle-Duck, may I sleep
in your nest all night?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Puddle-Duck poked her head up out
of her nest just a little way and then she shut her
eyes and stretched her wings out so far that she
covered her whole nest.</p>

<p>You see she had never seen a rabbit with red
wings in all her life.</p>

<p>So the little White Rabbit went and went until
he came to Old Mr. Ground Hog&#8217;s hole and Old
Mr. Ground Hog let him sleep with him all night,
but the hole had beech nuts spread all over it.
Old Mr. Ground Hog liked to sleep on them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
they hurt the little White Rabbit&#8217;s feet and made
him very uncomfortable before morning.</p>

<p>When it came morning, the little White Rabbit
decided to try his wings and fly a little, so he
climbed up on a hill and spread his wings and sailed
off, but he landed in a low bush all full of prickles,
and his four feet got mixed up with the twigs so
he couldn&#8217;t get down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mammy, Mammy, Mammy, come and help
me!&#8221; he called.</p>

<p>His Mammy didn&#8217;t hear him, but Old Mr.
Ground Hog did, and he came and helped the little
White Rabbit out of the prickly bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you-all want your red wings?&#8221; Mr.
Ground Hog asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <i>no</i>!&#8221; said the little White Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Old Ground Hog, &#8220;why don&#8217;t
you-all go down to the Wishing Pond and wish
them <i>off</i> again?&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little White Rabbit went down to the
Wishing Pond and he saw his face in it. Then he
turned around three times, and, sure enough, his
red wings were gone. Then he went home to his
Mammy, who knew him right away and was so
glad to see him and he never, <i>never</i> wished to be
something different from what he really was again.</p>

<small>STIMULATING THE EMOTIONS BY MEANS OF A
STORY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">A GROUP of school children recently
started quarreling in the school yard
during the morning recess time. The storm
center was two small boys who had fallen out
over a game of marbles. The entire class took
sides; <i>for</i> Edgar and <i>against</i> Edgar, <i>for</i> Lawrence
and <i>against</i> Lawrence and proceeded to
wage individual warfare like a miniature
army. Even the ringing of the school bell
failed to stop the quarrel. The children took
their seats unwillingly and with sour faces
carrying the feud with them into the classroom.</p>

<p>The teacher was a wise young person who
believed in attacking the matter of discipline
along the lines of least resistance. She saw
immediately that a general feeling of anger
possessed the children; no one child could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
blamed. So she set about creating an opposite,
general feeling as quickly as possible.
Setting aside other work for ten minutes she
announced a story. Instantly, the tension was
loosened. By the time she had finished
Grimm&#8217;s story of &#8220;The Pot and the Kettle,&#8221; in
which, as a climax, neither is able to taunt the
other with being black, the children&#8217;s anger
was gone, peace was restored, and the children
were smiling. An emotional crisis had been
successfully met by means of a story.</p>

<p>Our emotions, that is, our feelings of anger,
joy, sorrow, hatred, jealousy, and love are
older than we are. They may almost be
classed as instinctive, for they manifest themselves
so early. The baby gives examples of
emotional explosions in his first month.
These feelings have their rise in mental conditions
over which we have no control; they
are not dependent upon sensory stimuli; they
are isolated, incoherent. They take hold of
the personality of the subject in a hypnotic
fashion, for the period of the feeling&#8217;s mastery
we <i>are</i> anger, love, sorrow, or whatever emotion
enthralls us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>The psychologists classify and subdivide the
emotions into many divisions but the story teller
is most concerned with making one elastic,
wide classification of a child&#8217;s emotions; those
that are concerned with <i>bodily expression</i>. A
child is happy, he laughs; he is sad and he
cries; he is angry, he fights; he is afraid, and
he gives active evidence of cowardice. Because,
during the time of his obsession by one
of these emotions, a child is so completely
mastered by his feelings, we discover that we
can create for him by story suggestion a similar
mental state.</p>

<p><i>The story which a child feels is going to be
a force in his emotional development.</i></p>

<p>I came across one of my own, old Mother
Goose books not long ago with the leaves that
held the story of the &#8220;Babes in the Wood&#8221;
<i>pinned</i> securely together. It told me as nothing
else could have done the emotion caused
in a child&#8217;s mind by this gruesome tale. I
was afraid when I read the story. I felt all
the terror experienced by the Babes in the
Wood. My fear emotion was so unpleasant
that I had pinned the story out of my sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
I wanted to feel some other emotion. Other
children have similar emotions.</p>

<p>We will study stories, then, asking ourselves:</p>

<p><i>What emotion does this story stimulate?</i></p>

<p>By its unpleasant situations and images, does
it inspire fear in a child? Does it make a
child happy because of its bubbling good humor?
Does it create child sympathy, courage,
grief, anger, malice, charity, temperance?
Each one of these states of feeling is
characterized by bodily expression and we
can almost mold character, and influence a
child&#8217;s future life activity by means of the
stories which we tell him.</p>

<p>Sometimes our sole object in this story emotion
work will be to create an atmosphere of
good humor and happiness in our children.
Not by any means to be despised is the ability
to make a child laugh. The power to feel
humor in childhood means the power to take
life not too seriously in adult life and the story
that simply amuses and entertains has an important
place in the story hour. In this class
of happiness-making stories are: &#8220;Bre&#8217;r Rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and the Little Tar Baby,&#8221; &#8220;Johnny Cake,&#8221;
&#8220;Epaminondos and His Aunty,&#8221; &#8220;The Mouse
and the Sausage,&#8221; &#8220;The Greedy Cat,&#8221;
&#8220;Lambikin,&#8221; &#8220;Chicken Little,&#8221; &#8220;The Cat and
the Mouse&#8221; and a score more of sheer nonsense
stories whose very improbability makes
them tickle a child&#8217;s sense of humor and gives
him the opportunity to express his feelings in
laughter.</p>

<p>So many more stories than we realize put
children into a state of fear. Oldest of all our
emotions, since we share it alike with animals,
fear peculiarly takes hold of a child
during the early years when he is most interested
in stories. The story situation that
seems quite plausible to us and not in the least
terrorizing, haunts a child at night, peers
from shadowy corners at him in the daytime
and makes of him, unwittingly, a little coward.
The troll with only one eye, the giant
who cracks human bones, the witch who exercises
horrible spells should all be buried in
some tomb of forgetfulness. Stories having
such themes do nothing toward creating worthwhile
emotions in the child&#8217;s mind. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their very improbability makes them plausible
for us, they are, on the other hand, very
real to children and should be avoided.</p>

<p>But we can make children self reliant and
brave by giving them feelings of courage
through listening to courage stories. The
child who hears the stories of &#8220;Cedric, the
Little Hero of Harlem,&#8221; &#8220;The Story of a
Short Life,&#8221; &#8220;David and Goliath,&#8221; &#8220;Jean
D&#8217;Arc,&#8221; &#8220;Tiny Tim,&#8221; &#8220;Jenny Wren,&#8221; is made
one with each child hero, feels with them,
dares with them, acts with them.</p>

<p><i>Each emotion that will prevail over and
influence human action in adult life may be
appealed to in childhood through stories.</i></p>

<p>The child who is greedy and selfish is led
into a better state of feeling when he hears
the story of &#8220;The King of the Golden River.&#8221;
Always greed and avarice will be associated
in his mind with the tragic end of the brothers,
and the Happy Valley, full of plenty, and enjoyed
by Gluck, will symbolize for him the reward
of unselfishness. The child who is
proud will feel the opposite emotion, humbleness,
when he hears Oscar Wilde&#8217;s wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
parable of &#8220;The Star-Child.&#8221; As children
follow the wanderings of the Star-Child, his
beauty gone, his mother lost to him because of
his pride and, with him, find the successful
end of the journey, they lose their own pride
of heart with their story hero.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;And the gate of the palace opened, and the
priests and the high officers of the city ran forth
to meet him, and they abased themselves before
him, and said, &#8216;Thou art our lord for whom we
have been waiting, and the son of our King.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Star-Child answered them and said,
&#8216;I am no king&#8217;s son, but the child of a poor beggar-woman.
And how say ye that I am beautiful,
for I know that I am evil to look at.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt
flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that
had wings, held up a shield, and cried, &#8216;How saith
my lord that he is not beautiful?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face
was even as it had been, and his comeliness had
come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes
which he had not seen there before.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the priests and the high officers knelt
down and said to him, &#8216;It was prophesied of old
that on this day should come he who was to rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
over us. Therefore, let our lord take this crown
and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy
our King over us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he said to them, &#8216;I am not worthy, for I
have denied the mother who bare me, nor may I
rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.
Therefore, let me go, for I must wander
again over the world, and may not tarry here,
though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.&#8217;
And as he spake he turned his face from them
towards the street that led to the gate of the city,
and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round
the soldiers, he saw the beggar-woman who was
his mother, and at her side stood the leper, who
had sat by the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he
ran over, and kneeling down he kissed the wounds
on his mother&#8217;s feet, and wet them with his tears.
He bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as
one whose heart might break, he said to her:
&#8216;Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.
Accept me in the hour of my humility. Mother,
I gave thee hatred. Do thou give me love.
Mother, I rejected thee. Receive thy child
now.&#8217; But the beggar-woman answered him not
a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he reached out his hands, and clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the white feet of the leper, and said to him:
&#8216;Thrice did I give thee of my mercy. Bid my
mother speak to me once.&#8217; But the leper answered
him not a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he sobbed again, and said: &#8216;Mother,
my suffering is greater than I can bear. Give me
thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.&#8217;
And the beggar-woman put her hand on his head,
and said to him: &#8216;Rise,&#8217; and the leper put his
hand on his head, and said to him &#8216;Rise,&#8217; also.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he rose up from his feet, and looked at
them, and lo! they were a King and a Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Queen said to him, &#8216;This is thy father
whom thou hast succored.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the King said, &#8216;This is thy mother whose
feet thou hast washed with thy tears.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and
brought him into the palace, and clothed him in
fair raiment, and set the crown upon his head,
and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that
stood by the river he ruled, and was its lord.
Much justice and mercy did he show to all, and
the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter
and his wife he sent many rich gifts, and
to their children he gave high honour. Nor
would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast,
but taught love and loving-kindness and charity,
and to the poor he gave bread, and to the naked he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in
the land.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>What more effective emotional stimulus
could be found than this?</p>

<p>The children whom we wish to feel pity
should hear Andersen&#8217;s &#8220;Ugly Duckling&#8221;;
Oscar Wilde&#8217;s, &#8220;The Birthday of the Infanta&#8221;;
Daudet&#8217;s, &#8220;The Last Lesson&#8221;; &#8220;The House in
the Wood&#8221; and &#8220;The Star Dollars&#8221; by Grimm
and many other <i>sympathy</i> stories that only
wait for our timely rendering.</p>

<p>In telling a story, having in mind its emotional
effect upon a child&#8217;s mental life, we
will need to use the greatest delicacy of discrimination
in order to create just the story effect
which we wish. We will not tell such
stories so often as to cause them to lose their
magic spell. We will appeal to but one emotion
at a time through the story medium. We
will make an appeal most strongly to those
emotions that have bodily expression in a
child&#8217;s daily speech and acts. We will remember
that a child is so quick to smiles, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
quick to tears that the pleasanter feelings
should be the aim of our telling of emotion
stories rather than the unpleasant ones.</p>

<p>Some of us may class Miss Mulock&#8217;s story
of &#8220;The Little Lame Prince&#8221; as just a purely
imaginative one; others of us are appealed to
by its dramatic qualities. But, after all, the
story has survived the test of years because of
its big emotional appeal. It stands for pity,
sympathy, courage, nearly all the emotions
which we wish to strengthen in children.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Little Lame Prince</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, he was the most beautiful Prince that ever
was born. Everybody was exceedingly proud of
him, especially his father and mother, the King
and Queen of Nomansland. The only person who
did not love the Prince was the King&#8217;s brother, who
would have been king one day if the royal baby
had not come.</p>

<p>Of course a little Prince must be christened.
The day came at last, as lovely as the Prince himself,
and they carried the baby, magnificent in his
christening robe, to the bedside of the Queen, his
mother. She admired him very much. She kissed
and blessed him, and then she gave him up with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
gentle smile, and turned peacefully over in her bed,
saying nothing more to anybody.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful christening procession:
dukes and duchesses, princes and princesses, heralds,
and ladies in waiting were in line. Every one
was so busy shouting out the little Prince&#8217;s four and
twenty names that they never noticed the accident.
It was the Prince&#8217;s state nurse maid, an elegant
young lady of rank, who let him fall just at the foot
of the marble staircase. She had been so busy arranging
her train&mdash;that was the reason she
dropped him&mdash;but she contrived to pick him up
again the next minute before any one saw. The
baby had turned very pale under the heap of lace
and muslin, and he had moaned a little, but that
was all.</p>

<p>There were pages in crimson and gold, troops
of little girls in dazzling white with baskets of flowers,
the King and his train on one side&mdash;as pretty
a sight as ever was seen out of fairyland.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing the baby wants is a fairy godmother,&#8221;
said one of the children.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he?&#8221; said a shrill, but soft voice behind.</p>

<p>She was no bigger than a child, and certainly had
not been invited to the christening. She was a little
old woman dressed all in gray; gray gown, gray
hooded cloak of a material tinted like the gray of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
an evening sky, gray hair, and her eyes were gray
also. Even her face had a soft gray shadow over
it, but she was not unpleasantly old, and her smile
was as sweet and childlike as the Prince&#8217;s own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the baby fall
again!&#8221;</p>

<p>The grand lady nurse started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who spoke? His Royal Highness is just going
to sleep,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless I must kiss him,&#8221; said the little
old woman. &#8220;I am his godmother.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and gave
the little Prince three kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;An insult to His Royal Highness,&#8221; said the
nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty shall hear of this,&#8221; said a lord-in-waiting.
But just then the little gray woman
faded away like air, and the great bell of the palace&mdash;the
bell which was only heard on the death of
some member of the Royal family&mdash;began to toll&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;nine
and twenty&mdash;just the
Queen&#8217;s age!</p>

<p>So when the little Prince was carried back to his
mother&#8217;s room, there was no mother to kiss him.
She had turned her face to the window whence one
could just see the Beautiful Mountains where she
was born. So gazing, she had quietly died.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>Everybody was very kind to the poor little
Prince, but, somehow, after his mother died, things
seemed to go wrong with him. From a beautiful
baby he became sickly and pale, and his legs, which
had been so fat and strong, withered and shrank.
When he tried to stand he only tumbled down.</p>

<p>A prince, and not able to walk! People began
to say what a misfortune it was to the country.
Rather a misfortune to him, also, poor little lad,
but he still had the old sweet look in his little face,
and his body grew if his legs did not. His Majesty,
the King, took very little notice of his son,
and one day he died, too, and they made the
Crown Prince, Regent, in his stead, and then
things went much worse with the little Prince.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Prince Regent did not mean to do
wrong. He told the country that the little Prince
would be better if he were sent for a while to the
Beautiful Mountains. So the poor little Prince
started, with two whole regiments to guard him,
and then there came back word that he had gone
on a much longer journey. They said that he had
died on the road, so the country went into mourning,
and then forgot all about their little lame
Prince. And the Regent was proclaimed King.</p>

<p>What really became of the Prince? Beyond
the Mountains there lay a barren tract of country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
with not a bush&mdash;not a tree. In summer the sunshine
fell upon it hour after hour, and in winter
the snow covered it steadily and noiselessly in one
great sheet. Not a pleasant place to live&mdash;and
no one did live there, evidently. The only human
habitation for miles and miles was one large, round
stone tower, circular, with neither doors nor windows,
save some slits in the wall near the top. And
the top was a hundred feet from the plain.</p>

<p>One winter night, when all the plain was white
with moonlight, there was seen crossing it a great
black horse, ridden by a man equally black, and
carrying before him on the saddle a woman and a
child. The woman had a sad, fierce look, and no
wonder, for she was a criminal under sentence of
death, but her sentence had been changed. She
was to live in the lonely tower with a child&mdash;only
as long as he lived. He was a little gentle boy,
with a sweet, sleepy smile. He had been tired
with his long journey. And he was very helpless,
with his poor, small, shrivelled legs, which could
neither stand nor run away&mdash;for the little boy was
the Prince.</p>

<p>When they reached the foot of the tower there
was light enough to see a huge chain dangling from
the top, half way. The man fitted together a ladder
and mounted, drawing up the Prince and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
nurse. Then he came down again and left them
alone.</p>

<p>And there they stayed for years.</p>

<p>It was not an unhappy life for the little boy.
He had all sorts and kinds of beautiful toys, and
more picture books than he could look at. He
learned to crawl like a fly, and to jump like a frog.
He played about from room to room&mdash;there were
four; parlor, kitchen, his nurse&#8217;s room, and his
own&mdash;and as he grew older he would sit at the slits
of windows and watch the sky, and wonder about
things&mdash;for his nurse never talked much.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had somebody to tell me all about the
world,&#8221; he said to himself once, &#8220;a real, live person.
Oh, I want somebody dreadfully!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, there sounded behind him, the tap-tap-tap
of a cane, and&mdash;what do you think he saw?</p>

<p>A little woman, no larger than he, with gray
hair, and a dress of gray, and there was a gray
shadow over her wherever she moved. But she
had the sweetest smile, and the prettiest hands,
which she laid on his shoulders, as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My own little boy, I couldn&#8217;t come until you
said you wanted me, but here I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you my mother?&#8221; asked the little Prince.
He had always wondered what had become of his
mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>&#8220;No, only your godmother,&#8221; said the little
woman, &#8220;but I love you as much as your mother
did, and I want to help you all I can, my poor little
boy. I am going to give you a present&mdash;a traveling
cloak,&#8221; but just then in came the Prince&#8217;s
nurse, and his lovely old godmother melted away,
as a rainbow melts out of the sky. He knew, for
he had watched one many a time.</p>

<p>And what of the traveling cloak? I will tell
you all about it.</p>

<p>It was the commonest-looking bundle imaginable&mdash;shabby
and small. It seemed no treasure at all;
only a circular, green piece of cloth, and quite worn
and shabby. It had a slit cut to the center, forming
a round hole for the neck, and that was all its
shape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what use will it be to me?&#8221; thought the little
Prince sadly. &#8220;I never go out. She must be
a rather funny person, this dear old godmother of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he spread it out on the floor, and sat
down in the center for all the world like a frog
on a water lily leaf. The edges of the cloak
began turning up&mdash;and&mdash;the cloak rose, slowly
and steadily, and higher and higher until the little
Prince was obliged to open the skylight to
let himself through. There they were outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Oh, it was wonderful, nothing but earth and sky
for a while. Then came the patches of flowers
that grew on the plain, white saxifrage, and yellow
lotus, and ground thistles. Next, he saw a
farm where cows and horses, lambs and sheep fed
in the meadows. Presently he heard a murmur in
the distance, like a gigantic hive of bees. It was
a great city which he was sailing over and the
cloak stopped directly over a palace.</p>

<p>Such a magnificent palace! It had terraces and
gardens, battlements and towers. Its windows
looked in all directions, but mostly toward the
Beautiful Mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if there is a king in this palace,&#8221;
thought the little Prince.</p>

<p>Just then the cloak settled down to the palace
roof between some great stacks of chimneys as
comfortably as if it were on the ground. There
were some broken tiles in the roof, and the Prince
peered in.</p>

<p>It was the largest room he had ever seen, and
very grand. There was the loveliest carpet ever
woven on the floor, a bed of flowers; but the room
was perfectly empty and silent. In the center of
a magnificent bed, large enough to hold six people,
lay a small figure, something like wax work, fast
asleep&mdash;very fast asleep. There were some sparkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
rings on the fingers and the nose was sharp
and thin, and a long gray beard lay over the breast.
Two little flies buzzed about the curtains of the
bed, and made the only sound&mdash;for the King was
dead.</p>

<p>Then there came a great shouting from the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long live the King! The King is dead&mdash;down
with the King! Hurrah for the Republic!
Hurrah for no government at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear godmother,&#8221; cried the little Prince.
&#8220;Let me go back to the tower.&#8221; And he suddenly
found himself in his own room alone and quiet&mdash;for
the traveling cloak had taken him there; after
which it folded itself into the tiniest bundle, and
tied its own knots, and rolled itself into the farthest
and darkest corner.</p>

<p>The clock was striking ten, and no nurse was to
be seen. The little lame Prince crawled about
from room to room on his weak little knees, but all
the four chambers were deserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nurse&mdash;dear nurse&mdash;please come back!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Come back and I will be the best boy in
the land!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she did not answer, nor come.</p>

<p>In truth the poor woman had not been such a
wicked woman after all. As soon as she heard of
the death of the King, she determined to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Nomansland, and set upon the throne its rightful
heir. She had persuaded the old black messenger
to take her down from the tower, and together
they galloped like the wind from city to city
spreading the news that the little lame Prince was
alive and well, and the noblest young Prince that
ever was born.</p>

<p>It was a bold stroke, but it succeeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the Prince! Let the little Prince
be our King,&#8221; came from end to end of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Everybody tried to remember what a dear baby
he once was, and nobody at all spoke of his lameness.
They went with great rejoicing; lords and
gentlemen, and soldiers traveling night and day to
fetch the little lame Prince.</p>

<p>They found him sitting on the floor&mdash;quite pale,
for he expected a far different end from this,
although he had decided to die, if die he must,
courageously, like a Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am only a little boy, but I will
try to be your King. I will do my best to make
the people happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there arose from inside and outside the
tower, such a shout as never yet was heard across
the lonely plain.</p>

<p>So the little lame Prince came to his own after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
all, and every one says he was the best King that
ever ruled Nomansland. His reign lasted for
years and years, and then he went away.</p>

<p>Whither he went, or who went with him, it is
impossible to say. But I myself believe that his
godmother took him on his traveling cloak to the
Beautiful Mountains. What he did there, or
where he is now, who can tell? I cannot. But
one thing I am quite sure of, that, wherever he is,
he is perfectly happy.</p>

<p>And so, when I think of him, am I.</p>

<small>IMAGINATION AND THE FAIRY STORY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHAT is child imagination?</p>

<p>The Puritans thought the imaginative
person was a liar. Old Salem said that
such a vision as is conjured into reality by the
imagination constituted witchcraft. Even to-day
there are parents and teachers who believe
that the child who has the power to pierce the
veil of reality and see into a beyond is a
dreamer who lacks stability of mind and practicality
of purpose. But the unexplainable
power by means of which a human mind
grasps a bundle of bare, dry facts, sorts them
over speculatively and then pieces them together
into a new, luminous bit of mind stuff,
different from anything seen, or heard or
handled by that personality before&mdash;this is the
miracle working of what we know as constructive
imagination. Edison chaining electricity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and perpetuating the human voice
imaged these wonders before he realized
them. Moissant saw air craft through the
telescope of his mind before he built bird machines.
Jane Addams saw, felt, imaged herself
alone, poor and an outcast before she
could successfully help her fellows. In adult
life, the power to image the unreal, the power
to feel with another personality spells genius,
as well as imagination.</p>

<p><i>Child imagination is a kaleidoscopic mind
method of seeing, and piecing, and patching
together ideas gathered by the senses, and
making of them a new concept.</i></p>

<p>No child ever saw a live fairy, but any child
will explain a fairy to you, quite plausibly,
because he has formed his own fairy concept.
A being with hair like his favorite small girl
friend, and the stature of his little sister&#8217;s
doll, having wings like the dragon fly he saw
last summer and dressed in something colored
and soft and rustling like his mother&#8217;s dresses,
a person capable of doing all that the story
books say she can do&mdash;this is a child&#8217;s mind
picture of a fairy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>No one of us ever saw Heaven but all of us
can describe it. A place of this world&#8217;s grass
and flowers and music and familiar, beloved
personalities transplanted, renewed, translated&mdash;this
is our manner of describing, of seeing
Heaven.</p>

<p>The child&#8217;s method of imaging a fairy and
our method of imaging Heaven are identical.
From known, experienced, familiar perceptions
we make a new, as yet unexperienced concept.
If we want a child to see Heaven, we
must help him to see fairies. Success, happiness,
efficiency, belief&mdash;all these in adult life
are dependent upon the proper stimulating of
the child&#8217;s constructive imagination.</p>

<p><i>A good fairy story is the best stimulus to
child imagination.</i></p>

<p>Not any fairy story, selected with slight discrimination
and told to a child just because it
is a story of fancy, however. &#8220;Blue Beard,&#8221;
&#8220;Ali Baba,&#8221; &#8220;The Cruel Stepmother&#8221; do little
but cause child nightmares and give children
ideas of cruelty, vengeance and crime.
These concepts will present themselves to the
child soon enough in the daily newspapers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Let us shut them out of the story hour. In
selecting a fairy story to tell to children, we
will first analyze it with exceeding care, asking
ourselves these questions in regard to it:</p>

<p><i>What constitutes the imaginative element of
this story?</i></p>

<p><i>Is its point of unreality an idea which we
want to give permanence in the child&#8217;s mind?</i></p>

<p><i>Is the story told in a series of such familiar,
known images that there is material in it for
stimulating the child&#8217;s constructive imagination?</i></p>

<p>If a fanciful story survives these three tests,
we may be sure that it is perfect.</p>

<p>There is Hans Andersen&#8217;s story of &#8220;The
Faithful Tin Soldier.&#8221; Its climax is told in
a lesson of heroism and faithfulness, qualities
that we wish to make permanent in the child&#8217;s
mind through the medium of the imagination.
And how are these qualities presented?
We find that they are made real to children
by means of familiar settings; a little boy is
playing with new toys upon his birthday, we
see the child going to bed, there is the coming-alive
of the toys in the play-room, the tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
soldier&#8217;s experiences in the street, his return
to the kitchen. Every child knows toys, a
birthday, a play-room, a city street in the rain,
a kitchen; but out of these patches of gray,
every-day pigment Andersen paints for children
a new, colored picture of fancy. Presented
in terms of the real we have the unreal;
a live tin soldier who is as heroic and faithful
as we wish our children to be. This is a perfect
imaginative story, a bit of unreality which
we wish to make real for children and told
in terms of child experience.</p>

<p>Alice Brown&#8217;s wonderful allegory, &#8220;The
Gradual Fairy,&#8221; is also perfect in its theme
and construction. Its hero, the Green Goblin,
wishes to become a fairy. The story of
his changing his ugly colors for those of the
flowers when he promises never to hurt them
again, losing his harsh, shrill voice by being
kind to the brook, and so gradually finding
beauty, is a marvellously compelling bit of
imagery to leave with a child and it is told in
familiar, right-at-hand word pictures. In
the several chapters of Jean Ingelow&#8217;s,
&#8220;Mopsa, the Fairy,&#8221; child hearers are transported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to familiar places, but places where the
unusual, the beautiful happens. The story
tells of the Winding Up Places where tired-out
horses are put in green pastures and are
allowed to grow back to colt-hood, and where
weary working folks are wound up, like
clocks, and given such vigor that they never
run down again.</p>

<p>Charles Kingsley, from the reality of a dirty
chimney sweep and a sooty chimney, takes
children voyaging into his paradise of fancy
under the sea. Eugene Field gives children
a permanent picture of Santa Claus in his
legend of &#8220;Claus.&#8221; There is the little lad,
Claus, up in the Northland, finding his greatest
happiness in carving wooden dolls and animals
for the children. When his parents disappear,
Claus lights his father&#8217;s forge fire and
in the wonder light of the Northern star
pledges himself to create child happiness.
The elves bringing him gifts of metal and precious
stones for his work, the forest giving him
its trees and greens, the reindeer drawing his
sleigh full of toys, the snow and frost speeding
him on his way&mdash;these give children the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
meaning of Claus&#8217; world saint-ship in terms of
the imagination.</p>

<p>Apply this threefold test to every imaginative
story and your selection will be infallible.</p>

<p><i>What does the story image?</i></p>

<p><i>Do I want to vivify this image for my children?</i></p>

<p><i>How does it stimulate the imagination?</i></p>

<p>The old, loved fairy stories that have lived
for centuries stand this test. The story of
Cinderella leaves a child with a mental picture
of a cinder maid full blown into a princess
but with this image is the lesson of rewarded
faithfulness to duty, and the story plot
is built up of familiar concepts; the kitchen,
a pumpkin, a party, a chiming clock, a tiny
slipper. &#8220;The House in the Wood,&#8221; &#8220;Little
Daylight,&#8221; &#8220;The Many Furred Creature,&#8221;
&#8220;Snow White and Rose Red,&#8221; &#8220;The Goose
Girl,&#8221; &#8220;Briar Rose,&#8221; &#8220;Spindle, Needle and
Shuttle,&#8221; &#8220;The Elves and the Shoemaker,&#8221;
&#8220;The Story of Midas,&#8221; &#8220;The Star Dollars,&#8221;
&#8220;Why the Sea is Salt,&#8221; &#8220;Tom Thumb,&#8221; all
these world-old fanciful tales take children
far afield but they leave them better off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
ethically, than before they heard them and
each story is a healthy stimulus to the imagination.</p>

<p>What is the place of the fairy story in the
story hour?</p>

<p>A good fairy story is like the touch of spice
that gives the needed zest to a dish, it is the
sweet at the end of the meal, it should not be
spoiled by over use, by voraciousness. We
will select our fairy stories with the utmost
care, measuring each by our threefold rule.
We will tell these perfect fairy tales occasionally
only, realizing that they will bear
frequent retelling and are to be the classics of
the child&#8217;s story literature.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful of all fairy
stories, Mary Wilkins Freeman wrote. &#8220;The
Blue Robin&#8221; is perfect in treatment and theme.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Blue Robin</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The country over which King Chrysanthemum
reigned was very far inland, so there was very little
talk about the sea-serpent, but everybody was
agitated over the question whether there was, or
was not, a Blue Robin.</p>

<p>The whole kingdom was divided about it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
members of parliament were &#8220;F. B. R.,&#8221; for Blue
Robin or &#8220;A. B. R.,&#8221; against Blue Robin. The
ladies formed clubs to discuss the question, and
sometimes talked whole afternoons about it, and
the children even laid down their dolls, and their
tops to search for the Blue Robin. Indeed, many
children had to be kept tied to their mother&#8217;s
apron-strings all the time to prevent them from
running away to a Blue Robin hunt. It was a
very common thing to see ladies going to a Blue
Robin club, with a child at each apron-string, pulling
back and crying, &#8220;I want to go hunting the
Blue Robin! I want to go hunting the Blue
Robin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The country was agitated over this question for
many years, then finally there were riots about it.</p>

<p>People had to lock themselves in their houses,
and when the Blue Robin party was uppermost,
paint blue robins on their front doors, and when
it was not, wash them off. After the riots commenced,
it was really almost all that people could
do to paint blue robins on and wash them off,
their front doors.</p>

<p>At last King Chrysanthemum had to take extreme
measures. He decided to consult the Wise
Man. A committee was chosen of eight
F. B. R.&#8217;s, and eight A. B. R.&#8217;s, and a chairman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and they set out at once, marching four abreast,
the chairman with his chair leading the way, to
consult the Wise Man. He had to be found before
he could be consulted, however, and that was
a very difficult matter. The Wise Man considered
it the height of folly to live like other people
in a house immovably fixed upon one spot
of ground, and therefore he always carried his
house about with him, as a turtle carries his
shell.</p>

<p>He had fashioned a little dwelling of cloth and
steel ribs, something like an umbrella, which he
strapped to himself, and lived in, traveling all over
the country in pursuit of wisdom.</p>

<p>The committee marched a whole week, before
they came upon the Wise Man one afternoon in a
pasture where huckleberries grew. He was standing
quite still when they approached and made
their obeisances. The Chairman of the committee
placed his chair, a rocking-chair with a red
plush cushion, before the Wise Man, seated himself,
and spoke. &#8220;All Hail, Wise Man!&#8221; said he
in a loud voice.</p>

<p>The Wise Man&#8217;s house had a little door in front
like a coach door, and two tiny windows. One
of the windows had the curtains drawn, but out
of the other looked the Wise Man&#8217;s calm blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
right eye. There was so much wisdom in his
two eyes that he knew people could not comprehend
it, so he always curtained one window. The
house was about one foot higher than his head,
and reached to his ankles. They could see his
feet in their leather sandals below it.</p>

<p>The Wise Man said not one word in response
to the Chairman&#8217;s salutation, only looked at him
with his blue right eye. Then the Chairman laid
the matter before the Wise Man and besought his
aid in the terrible situation of the country. After
the Chairman had ceased speaking there was a
silence for half an hour. Not a sound was to be
heard except the creaking of the Chairman&#8217;s rocking-chair.
Then the Wise Man cleared his
throat. The committee leaned forward expectantly,
but they had to wait another half hour before
he spoke, and then it was not very satisfactory.
&#8220;Ideas are not as thick as huckleberries
in this pasture,&#8221; was all he said.</p>

<p>The committee looked at one another, and
nodded ruefully. It was quite true, but it did not
help them in their dilemma. They waited another
half hour; then the Wise Man began moving
off across the pasture in his house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop, stop!&#8221; cried the Chairman. &#8220;Stop,
stop!&#8221; cried the committee. They all ran after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
him, and begged him not to go away until he had
given them some useful advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Offer a reward!&#8221; called out the Wise Man,
as he scudded away.</p>

<p>&#8220;For what, for what!&#8221; cried the committee.</p>

<p>&#8220;For finding the Blue Robin,&#8221; called out the
Wise Man, and then a puff of wind caught his
umbrella-like house, and he was lifted quite off
his feet, and bobbed away out of sight over the
huckleberry-bushes.</p>

<p>The committee hastened back to the city, and
reported. Another special parliament was called,
and the reward for finding the Blue Robin was offered.
That was really a difficult matter, because
the Princess Honey was only five years old,
and the customary reward&mdash;her hand in marriage&mdash;could
hardly be offered. However, it was
stated that if the finder of the Blue Robin was of
suitable age when the Princess was grown, she
should be his bride; and furthermore that he and
all his relatives should be pensioned for life and
that he should be appointed Poet Laureate, and
given a regiment, a steam yacht, a special train,
and a pound of candy every day from the national
candy mills. The offer was painted in blue letters
on yellow paper, and pasted up all over the country,
and then the search began in good earnest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Business all over the kingdom was at a standstill.
Nobody did anything but hunt the Blue Robin.</p>

<p>People ate nothing in those days but cornmeal
pudding, hastily mixed and boiled. There was
no bread baked, because all the bakers and all the
housewives were out hunting the Blue Robin. The
mothers untied the children from their apron-strings,
and the schools were all closed, because
it was agreed that finding the Blue Robin
and establishing peace in the kingdom, was of
more importance than books, and all the children
who were old enough were out hunting&mdash;that is,
all the children except Poppy.</p>

<p>It should be stated here that everybody in this
country, with the exception of the Princess, had a
flower-name. The Princess was so much sweeter,
that only the inmost sweetness of all flowers was
good enough for her name, and she was called
Honey.</p>

<p>Poppy was about ten years old, and his father
was an editor of a newspaper, and very poor. He
could scarcely support his five children. His wife
had died the year before, and he could not afford
to hire a housekeeper.</p>

<p>So Poppy had to stay at home, and keep the
house, and take care of his four young brothers
and sisters, while his father was away editing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
he could not hunt the Blue Robin. It was a great
cross to him, but he loved his little brothers and
sisters, and he made the best of it.</p>

<p>After the search for the Blue Robin began, his
father was much busier, and had often to be away
all night, so Poppy had to rock and trot the twin
babies, Pink and Phlox, and go without sleep, after
working hard cooking and washing dishes and
sewing all day. Poppy had to mend the children&#8217;s
clothes, and he was even trying to make some little
frocks for Petunia and Portulacca. They were
twins also, five years old.</p>

<p>As Poppy sat in the window and sewed, with
his right foot rocking Pink&#8217;s cradle, and his left
foot rocking Phlox&#8217;s, with Petunia and Portulacca
sitting beside him on their little stools, he told
them all he had ever heard about the wonderful
Blue Robin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody is even quite certain he has seen it,
himself,&#8221; said Poppy, &#8220;but he knows somebody
else, who knows somebody else, who has; and if
you ever could find the first somebody, why he
could tell where the Blue Robin was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t they find the first somebody?&#8221; asked
Portulacca.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he died before people were born,&#8221; said
Poppy. Then he went on and told Petunia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Portulacca how there was a wonderful blue stone
in the King&#8217;s crown, which was unlike all other
precious stones, and said to be the Blue Robin&#8217;s
egg; and how there was a little Blue Book in the
King&#8217;s library which had a strange verse in it about
the Blue Robin.</p>

<p>Then Poppy repeated the verse. He had
learned it at school. It ran in this way:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;He who loveth me alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Can tell me not from stick or stone;</div>
<div class="verse">He who loveth more than me,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall me in fullest glory see.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; asked Petunia and
Portulacca.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Poppy. Then he
mended faster than ever. Many children ran
past the window, hunting the Blue Robin, but he
did not complain, even to himself.</p>

<p>That night his father did not come home, and
Pink and Phlox cried as usual, and he had to rock
them, and trot them. About midnight, however,
they both fell asleep in their cradles, and Poppy
began to think he might get a little rest himself.
He could scarcely keep his eyes open. Petunia
and Portulacca had been sound asleep in their
cribs ever since seven o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Everything was very still, and he was just dozing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
when he heard a sound which made him start
up wide awake at once, although the children never
stirred. He heard a single sweet bird-pipe,
sweeter than anything he had ever heard in his life,
and it seemed to be right in the room at his
elbow. When the babies fell asleep Poppy
had blown out the candle, the hearth-fire had gone
out, and the room had been very dark, but now
something was shining on the table like a lamp,
which gave out a wonderful blue light. The sweet
pipe came again. Poppy stared at the blue light
on the table, which grew brighter and brighter,
until he saw what it was. The Blue Robin shone
on his table like a living sapphire, its blue wings
seeming to fan the blue light into flames, its blue
breast brighter than anything he had ever seen.</p>

<p>While all the world was out searching for the
Blue Robin, it had come of its own accord to
the poor little faithful boy in his poor little
home.</p>

<p>The children all slept soundly, and did not stir.
Poppy stood up trembling, and went over to the
table, and immediately the Blue Robin flew to his
hand, and clung there.</p>

<p>Then Poppy went out of the house, and down
the road to the King&#8217;s palace with the Blue Robin
on his hand. Although it was so late, scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
anybody had gone to bed. They were all out
with lanterns, hunting for the Blue Robin.</p>

<p>When Poppy with the Blue Robin on his hand
came in sight, all the lanterns went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; the people cried, &#8220;what is that
wonderful blue light?&#8221;</p>

<p>They crowded around Poppy.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden they shouted, &#8220;Poppy has
found the Blue Robin! Poppy has found the
Blue Robin!&#8221; and followed him to the King&#8217;s Palace.</p>

<p>The shouts were heard in the newspaper office
where Poppy&#8217;s father was hard at work, and he
ran to the window. When he saw his son with
the Blue Robin, he was overwhelmed with joy.
He stuck his pen behind his ear and came down
on the fire-escape, and also went to the palace.
The King had not gone to bed, though it was so
late, neither had the Queen. They were talking
about the Blue Robin and the perilous state of the
country with the Prime Minister, on the front
door-step.</p>

<p>When they saw Poppy and the Blue Robin, and
all the people, and heard the shouts of joy, the
King tossed his crown in the air, the Prime Minister
swung his hat, and the Queen ran in and
wrapped up the Princess Honey in a little yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
silk gown, and brought her to see the wonderful
sight.</p>

<p>It was wonderful&mdash;the Blue Robin on Poppy&#8217;s
hand seemed to light the whole city. Poppy, by
the King&#8217;s order, stood on the top door-step, and
everybody could see the bird on his hand. Then
the Blue Robin began to sing, and sang an
hour without ceasing, so loud that everybody could
hear.</p>

<p>When the bird stopped singing, the King advanced.
&#8220;You shall now receive your reward,&#8221;
he said to Poppy, &#8220;and I will take the Blue Robin,
and put him in a golden cage, and have him
guarded by a regiment of picked soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King extended his hand and Poppy his,
but just as the King touched the Blue Robin, he
disappeared. There came a faint song from far
above the city roofs, and people tipped back their
heads, and strained their eyes, but they could not
see the Blue Robin; they never saw him again, as
long as they lived.</p>

<p>However, he had been seen by many witnesses,
and the object of the search was attained. There
were no longer two parties in parliament, and the
country was in a state of perfect peace. Indeed,
parliament only met afterward to agree, and eat
cake and ice cream, and shake hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>Poppy had his reward at once&mdash;that is, everything
but the hand of the Princess Honey&mdash;and he
and his father and his little brothers and sisters,
were very rich and happy, until he grew to be a
man. Then the Princess Honey had grown to
be a beautiful maiden, and he married her with
great pomp, and the King gave them the Blue
Robin&#8217;s egg for a wedding-present.</p>

<small>MAKING OVER STORIES</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE average story must be cut and fitted
to meet the needs of the story teller
who wants to make a direct and vivid appeal
to her children. Writing a story for the
printed page and preparing a story for children&#8217;s
ears are two very different matters. In
the former case, there is no time limit set
upon the story; the reader may lay his story
book down at will when he tires of the printed
words, ready to take it up again when he has
the inclination. In the latter case, we have
to meet the mental and emotional needs of a
group of children whose attention must be
held by the compelling power of an orally delivered
story. To meet these story needs as
applied to oral delivery, a story has, ordinarily,
to be made over before it is told. It must
be made into a perfectly fitting garment for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
wrapping the child about with a clinging
cloak of imagination, full of colorful words
and truth. The story teller must do this story
adapting herself. How can she bring it about
in the quickest, most effectual way?</p>

<p>A large percentage of the stories printed for
children are <i>too long</i>. The story that is too
short and needs to be &#8220;padded&#8221; for telling is
very rarely to be found. In the case of the
Fables of Æsop and Bidpai the skeleton only
of each story is given and here the problem of
adapting for the story teller is to find a way of
filling in each picture in order to make the
story of the desired length.</p>

<p>But how shall we shorten the too-long story
that we want children to hear because of its
compelling theme and <i>motif</i>, but which is, very
likely, two thousand or twenty-five hundred
words long? This is the average difficulty
that the story teller meets in connection with
the average story. There is also the <i>time</i>
problem to be taken into consideration, as
well. While the story teller wants to spend
as much time as necessary in the preparation
of a story, this time ought to be reduced to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
minimum. Is there a short cut to story adaptation
and how may the story teller find
it?</p>

<p>One may almost reduce a recipe for making
over stories. It is possible to outline a pattern
by means of which a printed story may be
cut to fit the needs of a group of eager, restless,
wriggling children. Having this recipe,
this pattern, thoroughly in mind, a little practice
in applying it to particular stories that
need adapting will give the story teller power
to apply it, quickly and effectually to any story
with little loss of time. Its use will give the
story teller an added power in her work.
Knowing how to put stories in shape for telling
will help her to hold the attention of any
group of children.</p>

<p>The first step in our rule for adapting a
story that is too long is to carefully <i>read the
story</i>.</p>

<p>This seems too obvious a suggestion, almost,
to put upon a printed page, but reading a story
having in mind making it over means reading
it to find out <i>what happens</i> in the story, <i>what
is its important action, who are its necessary</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
<i>characters</i>, and <i>what is the climax</i>. This
first reading of a story for adaptation means
an analysis of the story plot. This kind of
story reading may be developed so as to become
the story teller&#8217;s habit in reading any
story, but it is the necessary, preliminary step
in all story adapting.</p>

<p>Our next step is to <i>find the pictures in the
story</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose you were a stage manager with the
problem of dramatizing this special story to
meet the interests of an audience, how would
you develop the different scenes in the story
so as to make it into a play that holds interest?
Suppose you are a film maker. What are the
moving pictures in the story to be presented
in their order of interest through the medium
of your film? We have much to learn from
the stage manager and the moving picture
man. Their problems are identical with those
of the story teller in that they must strip a
story plot bare of details, unnecessary description
and the opinions of the author. They
must give an audience the <i>naked story</i>. This
is all the audience wants. So it is with children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
They demand story <i>scenes</i>, story <i>pictures</i>
and nothing else.</p>

<p>The third and last step in story adaptation,
is to <i>prepare our story pictures for presentation
to the children</i>.</p>

<p>This step depends a good deal upon the
children for whom you are preparing the
story. If the children are foreign-born, you
will need to put each story picture into a
frame of very simple language. If yours are
country children, you will need to put country
images into the picture canvas. If they are
city children, the canvas may need a few fire
engines, parks and policemen to catch the
children&#8217;s attention. These will be, of course,
quite subsidiary to the real story interest which
must be preserved at all events.</p>

<p>It depends, also, upon the person who wrote
the story. If we are adapting Hans Christian
Andersen, Charles Dickens, Eugene Field or
any other master story teller for the special
needs of our story group, we must use the utmost
care in keeping the <i>form</i> of the author
and preserving his marvellous English. Too
often the story teller ruins a story in attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
to &#8220;tell it down&#8221; to children. It is possible
to shorten a good story and still keep it
the author&#8217;s own. It depends, most of all,
upon determining the elements of <i>action</i>, <i>dialogue</i>
and <i>description</i> necessary to make the
story picture a fixture in the child&#8217;s mind.
Children want to know &#8220;what happens&#8221; in
each scene of the story. This constitutes all
their interest.</p>

<p>These, to sum up, are our steps in story
adaptation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Read the story, analytically.</i></p>

<p><i>Select its necessary scenes.</i></p>

<p><i>Reduce these scenes to elements of action.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We shall find it helpful to apply these separate
steps to some one special story which we
wish to present to children and which is too
long for our use.</p>

<p>There is no more beautiful story in all literature
than Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s &#8220;The
Girl Who Trod on the Loaf.&#8221; It is full of
the sensory appeal, the colorful word picturing,
the imagery, the ethics which we look for
in a perfect story, but as it stands in the best
translation, it is almost three thousand words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
long and so hedged about with Andersen&#8217;s
beautiful, but adult philosophy that it is quite
beyond the comprehension of children. As a
result, it is seldom told to children and is one
of the least well-known of the author&#8217;s fairy
tales. Let us see if we can put it in shape for
telling without, in the slightest degree, hurting
Andersen&#8217;s style.</p>

<p>We read the story analytically and find that
it divides itself into four scenes, all of which
are necessary to preserve the story interest.
These are:</p>

<p>1. Inge&#8217;s sinning.</p>

<p>2. Inge&#8217;s descent to the abode of the Moor
Woman.</p>

<p>3. Inge&#8217;s repentance and transformation
into the bird.</p>

<p>4. The bird&#8217;s Christmas work and journey.</p>

<p>This analysis strips the story bare of detail.
Each of these scenes, in the original story, is
elaborated, split up into minor scenes, and they
cover a very long period of time, which makes
the story difficult for a child to understand.
But if we keep carefully in mind these four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
separate pictures into which the story resolves
itself and fill each picture with as little description
as possible and only the essential
action for carrying children by the quickest
possible route to the climax, we find ourselves
equipped with a new, shorter story, told in
Andersen&#8217;s words and ready for retelling to
our children.</p>

<p>It will be well to compare this adapted version
of the story as it appears here with the
original story to be found in any translation
of Hans Christian Andersen&#8217;s stories to determine
the omitted description, action and detail.
The method of adapting this story is a
model for other story adapting.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Girl Who Trod on the Loaf</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The girl&#8217;s name was Inge; she was a poor
child, but proud and presumptuous.</p>

<p>With years she grew worse rather than better.</p>

<p>She was sent into the country, in service, in the
house of a rich people who kept her as their own
child, and dressed her in corresponding style. She
looked well, and her presumption increased.</p>

<p>When she had been there about a year, her mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
said to her, &#8220;You ought once to visit your
parents, Inge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you a present of a great wheaten
loaf that you may give to them; they will certainly
be glad to see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Inge put on her best clothes, and her new
shoes, and drew her skirts around her, and set out,
stepping very carefully that she might be clean and
neat about the feet; and there was no harm in that.
But when she came to the place where the footway
led across the moor, and where there were mud
and puddles, she threw the loaf into the mud, and
trod upon it to pass over without wetting her feet.</p>

<p>But as she stood there with one foot upon the
loaf and the other uplifted to step farther, the loaf
sank with her, deeper and deeper, till she disappeared
altogether, and only a great puddle, from
which the bubbles rose, remained where she had
been.</p>

<p>Whither did Inge go? She sank into the moor
ground, and went down to the Moor Woman, who
is always brewing there. The Moor Woman is
cousin to the Elf Maidens, who are well enough
known, of whom songs are sung, and whose pictures
are painted; but concerning the Moor
Woman it is only known that when the meadows
steam in summer-time, it is because she is brewing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Into the Moor Woman&#8217;s place did Inge sink down;
and no one can endure that place long. A box of
mud is a palace compared with the Moor Woman&#8217;s
brewery. Every barrel there has an odor that
almost takes away one&#8217;s senses; and the barrels
stand close to each other; and wherever there is a
little opening among them, through which one
might push one&#8217;s way, the passage becomes impracticable
from the number of damp toads and fat
snakes who sit out their time there. Among this
company did Inge fall! and she shuddered and became
stark and stiff.</p>

<p>She continued fastened to the loaf and the loaf
drew her down as an amber button draws a fragment
of straw.</p>

<p>That was a never ending antechamber where
Inge found herself. There was a whole crowd of
sinful people there, too. Great, fat, waddling
spiders spun webs of a thousand years over the
people&#8217;s feet, webs that cut like wire and bound
them like bronze fetters. Inge felt a terrible pain
while she had to stand there as a statue, for she was
tied fast to the loaf. Her clothes had been soiled
with mud in coming down to the Moor Woman&#8217;s
place; a snake was fastened in her hair and out of
each fold in her muddy frock a great toad looked
forth, croaking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>The worst of all was the terrible hunger that
tormented her. But could she not stoop and break
off a piece of the loaf on which she stood? No,
her back was too stiff, her hands and arms were
benumbed, and her whole body was like a pillar
of stone; only she was able to turn her eyes in her
head, to turn them quite round, so that she could
see backwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this lasts much longer,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall not
be able to bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she had to bear it, and it lasted on and on.</p>

<p>Her mother and all on earth knew of the sin she
had committed; knew that she had trodden upon
the loaf, and had sunk and disappeared; for the
cowherd had seen it from the hill beside the moor.</p>

<p>And then she heard how her story was told to
the little children, and the little ones said that she
was so naughty and ugly that she must be well
punished.</p>

<p>But one day when Inge was very hungry, she
heard her name mentioned and her story was told
to an innocent child. The little girl burst into
tears at the tale of the haughty, vain Inge.</p>

<p>&#8220;But will Inge never come up here again?&#8221;
asked the little girl.</p>

<p>And the reply was, &#8220;She will never come up
again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>&#8220;But if she were to say she was sorry, and to
beg pardon, and say she would never do so again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, then she might come,&#8221; was the reply, and
the words penetrated to Inge&#8217;s heart and did her
good, and a tear of penitence dropped down on the
loaf.</p>

<p>Again time went on&mdash;a long, bitter time, but at
last Inge heard some one call her name and she
saw two bright stars that seemed gleaming above
her. The little girl who had been sorry for Inge
was now an old woman and had gone to Heaven.
She was calling to Inge. She was still sorry for
her.</p>

<p>And a wonderful thing happened. A beam of
light shot radiantly down into the depths of the
Moor Woman&#8217;s place with all the force of the sunbeam
which melts the snow man the boys have
built. More quickly than the snowflake turns to
water, the stony form of Inge was changed to mist,
and a little bird soared with the speed of lightning
upward into the world of men. But the bird was
timid and shy towards all things around; he was
ashamed of himself, ashamed to encounter any
living thing, and hurriedly sought to conceal himself
in a dark hole in an old crumbling wall; there
he sat cowering, trembling through his whole
frame.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>Then, presently, it was the blessed Christmas
time. The peasant who dwelt near set up a pole
by the old wall with some ears of corn bound to
the top, that the birds of heaven might have a good
meal, and rejoice in the happy, blessed time.</p>

<p>And on Christmas morning the sun arose and
shone upon the ears of corn, which were surrounded
by a number of twittering birds. Then
out of the hole in the wall streamed forth the voice
of another bird, and the bird soared forth from his
hiding-place; and in heaven it was well known what
bird this was.</p>

<p>It was a hard winter. The ponds were covered
with ice, and the beasts of the field and the birds
of the air were stinted for food. Our little bird
soared away over the high road, and in the ruts
of the sledges he found here and there a grain of
corn, and at the halting-places some crumbs. Of
these he ate only a few, but he called all the other
hungry sparrows around him, that they, too, might
have some food. He flew into the towns, and
looked round about; and wherever a kind hand had
strewn bread on the window-sill for the birds, he
only ate a single crumb himself, and gave all the
rest to the other birds.</p>

<p>In the course of the winter, the bird had collected
so many bread-crumbs, and given them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the other birds, that they equalled the weight of
the loaf on which Inge had trod to keep her shoes
clean; and when the last bread-crumb had been
found and given, the gray wings of the bird became
white, and spread far out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder is a sea-swallow, flying away across the
water,&#8221; said the children, when they saw the white
bird. Now it dived into the sea, and now it rose
again into the clear sunlight. It gleamed white;
but no one could tell whither it went, though some
asserted that it flew straight into the sun.</p>

<small>PLANNING STORY GROUPS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE children who hear one story well
told eagerly demand,</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us another!&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the natural, to-be-desired longing of
the child mind to be satiated with good stories.
We endeavor to meet the children&#8217;s wish
for a number of stories in each story hour but
we often hurt the mental and moral effect of
one story by telling in close connection another
story that has no interest connection with
the last one told. We lead the child from one
story interest to another with slight attention
to the influence which the <i>story group</i> will
have upon the minds of the children. We
tell, perhaps, a home story, then a nature story,
and last of all a holiday story in one story hour,
and in doing this we so quickly transfer the
child&#8217;s attention from one theme to a distinctly
different one that there is no cohesion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in our story building. We break down instead
of building up the powers of concentration
of our children.</p>

<p>Planning a group of stories for one story
hour is quite as much a matter to be studied as
is the selection of each individual story in the
group and preparing this story for telling.
The story combination selected by the story
teller must have the qualities of cohesion,
unity of theme, and related interests to make
the story hour valuable in the child&#8217;s life. On
the other hand, the unity of theme in the separate
stories chosen must be emphasized by
contrasting story treatment of this central
theme. A group of stories in which each
story is just like its predecessor and similar to
the story that follows will tire the child listeners.
We must bring about cohesion in the
story hour by means of contrast in the treatment
of each story.</p>

<p>Our first thought in planning story groups
will be:</p>

<p><i>Select the story theme for the story hour.</i></p>

<p>This story theme will be some idea which
we want to bring forcefully to the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
our children. The story hour <i>motif</i> may be:
animals, the home, trades, birds, flowers,
heroes, a holiday or some ethical theme as:
honesty, truth or charity, but each of the
stories selected for the story group will have
an animal, home, trade, bird, flower, hero,
holiday, honesty, truth or charity theme.</p>

<p>Our second thought in planning story
groups will be:</p>

<p><i>Select stories which present the selected
theme in contrasting treatment.</i></p>

<p>Three stories form an excellent number for
one story hour. Each of these stories will illustrate
one central idea that a <i>continuing
thread of interest</i> may be carried through the
story group and knotted at the end of the story
hour. But each story will make a <i>different
mental appeal in presenting the theme</i> that the
children may have the benefit of <i>contrast</i> in
helping them to concentrate upon listening to
all the stories that make up the group.</p>

<p>The first of these three stories should be selected
having in mind the securing of the <i>involuntary
attention</i> of the children. It should
be an <i>apperceptive</i> story that finds quick interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in the minds of the children because
its ideas are <i>their</i> ideas, its scenes are familiar
to theirs and its characters are people like the
people whom they meet and know in their
every-day environment. Having caught the
children&#8217;s attention involuntarily by a story
that finds a place by its familiarity of treatment
in their own lives, the second story in the
group may make a different mental appeal.
It may make the children <i>reason</i>; it may take
them far afield in their thinking, it may be the
longest story in the group and so call for
greater concentration on the part of the story
teller.</p>

<p>The last story in the story group will be selected
for <i>mental relaxation</i> after the tense attention
demanded for the second story. It
may be a humorous story, a very short story, or
one so contrasted in treatment to the other
stories in the group that it gives rest because
of its difference.</p>

<p>To illustrate with one typical story group
will be helpful.</p>

<p>We wish to make the thought of <i>industry</i>
the central thought for a story hour. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
first story in the story group might be &#8220;The
Sailor Man&#8221; by Laura E. Richards. This
story catches and holds the children&#8217;s attention
at once because its characters are familiar
to them; its setting is one that they can quickly
see in their imagination. They have much in
common with the two children who go to visit
the sailor man; they know sailors; they have
been to the seashore; they have enjoyed boat
rides. And the climax of the story is a lesson
in industry. The child who most industriously
ties knots in the sailor&#8217;s fish nets wins
the reward.</p>

<p>The second story in the group, &#8220;The Stone
in the Road,&#8221; makes the children think more
forcefully than did the first one. It takes
them farther afield and makes them see in
imagination, wealth, a castle, gold, poverty.
They are obliged to reason in interpreting the
rich man&#8217;s motive in hiding his gold. The
story makes the children use their dawning
power of judging.</p>

<p>The last story selected for this special story
group is, &#8220;Drakesbill,&#8221; a humorous folk tale.
The hero, an industrious duck who has worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
hard all his life to accumulate a competence
upon which he may live in his old age, loans
a large sum of money to the king. The king
being slow in paying back the money, Drakesbill
goes to the palace to collect his debt. His
adventures on the way and the successful end
of his journey form the interest of the story.
This story makes a fine climax to the story
group. While it still emphasizes the central
thought of the story program, industry, it
treats it in a different way from that in which
the previous stories illuminate the theme. Its
fantasy, its humor make it a relaxation for the
children.</p>

<p>If story groups are arranged having in mind
these two considerations: <i>a central theme</i> and
<i>contrast in the treatment of this theme</i> the
story hour will be a vital force for good in the
development of the children&#8217;s mental and
moral life.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the story teller who has
slight time for the consulting of many books
of stories which such a planning of story
groups entails, some illustrative story programs
follow, each of which has been arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
with reference to one child-interest
theme carried through three different types of
stories.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
